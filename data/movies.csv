Searching for Satoshi: the Mysterious Disappearance of the Bitcoin Creator,"Bitcoin, Mystery, origin of Bitcoin",relevant,2023,Investigative Documentary,"Canada, United Kingdom",44 min,"November 1, 2023",Paul Kemp,"Mike Lorrey, Samson Mow",Searching For Satoshi Trailer,https://filmfund.113kw.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/satoshi-03.png,Investigation into Satoshi Nakamoto’s identity and disappearance. Who is the mysterious inventor of Bitcoin?,"Searching for Satoshi follows journalists and hackers on a global quest to uncover Bitcoin’s elusive creator. Blending cyber investigation with philosophical questions about anonymity, it’s a detective story of the digital age.","On January 3, 2009, a secretive software engineer with the pseudonym „Satoshi Nakamoto“ launched the world’s newest monetary invention: a cryptocurrency called bitcoin. Just over two years after bitcoin was introduced, Nakamoto vanished, with over one million bitcoin to his name. The mystery inventor’s worth has reached as high as $70 billion, but not a single one of those bitcoins has ever traded hands or moved from Nakamoto’s online wallet. After sending a few cryptic emails stating he „may not be around,“ Nakamoto went silent and has not been heard from since early 2011. Why did Nakamoto disappear? Some have speculated that he may have taken his own life. Or maybe he wanted to wash his hands of his bitcoin project, walking away from it all and maintaining his anonymity. In this film, director and producer Paul Kemp goes on a worldwide journey to piece together the most compelling case yet for who Satoshi Nakamoto was and why he disappeared.

Searching for Satoshi: The Mysterious Disappearance of the Bitcoin Creator is a fascinating documentary that delves into one of the biggest mysteries of the digital age. Directed by Paul Kemp, this film explores the enigmatic figure behind bitcoin, the decentralized cryptocurrency that has revolutionized the financial landscape. Satoshi Nakamoto’s invention has shaped the modern economic world, yet his sudden disappearance left behind more questions than answers. Kemp’s documentary sets out to unravel the mystery of who Nakamoto might be, where he went, and why he chose to vanish from public life at the height of his creation’s success.

Kemp takes the audience on a global journey, interviewing tech experts, bitcoin insiders, and conspiracy theorists to build a picture of Nakamoto’s possible identity and motivations. The film provides an in-depth exploration of bitcoin’s origin story and the implications of having its inventor disappear without a trace. Through archival footage, expert interviews, and even some cryptographic analysis, Searching for Satoshi digs deep into the mythology surrounding Nakamoto, examining the mystery from every angle.

The film doesn’t shy away from addressing the darker theories surrounding Nakamoto’s disappearance, including suggestions that the inventor might have met a grim fate or deliberately erased himself from the public eye to maintain his anonymity. Some even speculate that Nakamoto’s departure was intentional—a way to ensure bitcoin’s decentralization, free from any one person’s influence. Others wonder if Nakamoto was one person or a collective, or perhaps even an intelligence operation.

Despite all the theories, no definitive answer has emerged, and Searching for Satoshi emphasizes the ongoing debate over Nakamoto’s legacy. Was Satoshi a visionary who simply wanted to give the world a tool for financial freedom? Or did he flee the public spotlight to avoid the dangers and pressures that came with creating a revolutionary new form of currency? Kemp’s documentary raises these questions while maintaining a balanced narrative that avoids sensationalism, focusing instead on the real implications of Nakamoto’s absence.

For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and curious newcomers alike, Searching for Satoshi offers an engaging, thought-provoking look into the man—or group—behind bitcoin. It’s not just a story about bitcoin’s origins, but also a broader reflection on privacy, technology, and the individuals who can shape the world in unprecedented ways while remaining in the shadows.

A group of vigilantes plots to capture a crypto kingpin — but moral lines blur as they realize they’ve become as ruthless as the man they chase.,"After losing everything in a cryptocurrency scam, a ragtag team of vigilante Redditors attempt to kidnap the kingpin who screwed them over. But when the home invasion takes a turn for the worst, they become victims in a sadistic game.

Directed by Cutter Hodierne, Cold Wallet takes audiences into the heart of a thrilling, chaotic world where cryptocurrency is not just the backdrop but the catalyst for a gripping narrative of revenge, greed, and survival. The film, starring Raúl Castillo as the relentless lead, delivers a dark, action-packed tale inspired by the volatility and unpredictability of the crypto industry.

At its core, Cold Wallet follows a group of amateur vigilantes who, after losing their life savings in a crypto scam, decide to take justice into their own hands. Their plan to kidnap the crypto kingpin responsible seems foolproof until it spirals out of control, trapping them in a nightmarish game where the lines between victim and villain blur. As the situation grows more sinister, the group faces escalating violence, betrayal, and a fight for survival they never anticipated.

What sets Cold Wallet apart is its unique positioning as one of the first films to directly tackle cryptocurrency as a central plot element. Yet, while the film excels in tension and thrills, it also presents a rather negative portrayal of the crypto world, framing it as a space rife with deceit and danger. This angle, while engaging for audiences, paints crypto enthusiasts and those involved in the industry as opportunists, constantly at risk of falling into treacherous schemes. For those who see cryptocurrency as a transformative, decentralized technology with vast potential, this portrayal may feel overly cynical.

Hodierne’s direction, coupled with Castillo’s strong performance, creates a relentless sense of urgency and dread. The film doesn’t shy away from exploring the darker sides of the human psyche, exposing the desperation that can arise when financial stability is ripped away in an instant. The narrative taps into current anxieties surrounding digital assets, while also delving into the consequences of relying on an unregulated and often misunderstood financial landscape.

Critics have praised Cold Wallet for its gritty realism, sharp dialogue, and the way it captures the frantic energy of a group of ordinary people caught up in extraordinary circumstances. The film’s atmosphere is one of constant tension, with an unpredictable plot that keeps viewers on edge from start to finish.

While Cold Wallet effectively brings the drama and suspense, it also leans into the trope of crypto as a dangerous game for those who are unaware or ill-prepared. Nevertheless, for thriller enthusiasts and those curious about how digital finance intersects with human nature, the film offers a raw, engaging experience."

Set in the world of crypto influencers and quick money, it’s a tale of manipulation, greed, and self-discovery.","A con artist in dire need of cash and a woman with a crypto fortune hit it off. Is she the target of his dreams, or is the scammer about to get scammed? Trapped by his own lies to please the sublime Stella and ensure their lifestyle, Thiago commits little scams to keep up appearances. Unsurprisingly, when the masks fall (well, especially his wig), his life collapses. However, when he crosses paths with Stéphanie, on the verge of becoming extremely rich thanks to cryptocurrency, he regains confidence. Would she be the solution to all his problems or has he found his master?

Directed by Julien Hollande, the movie is a fast-paced French romantic action-comedy that follows the misadventures of Thiago, a small-time con artist played by Nassim Lyes (as Yussuf / Thiago), and Zoé Marchal as Stéphanie, a soon-to-be crypto millionaire. Their worlds collide in a hilarious, high-stakes game of deception and romance, where no one is quite what they seem, and everyone has something to hide.

Thiago, caught in a web of lies and desperate schemes, finds himself drawn to Stéphanie, whose newfound wealth from cryptocurrency seems like the perfect solution to his mounting problems. But as Thiago gets closer to Stéphanie, it becomes clear that the real question is: who is conning whom? The film deftly blends elements of romance and action, as Thiago’s schemes spiral out of control, and Stéphanie proves to be far more cunning than he ever imagined.

With sharp, witty dialogue and a cast that exudes on-screen chemistry, All Time High takes viewers on a wild ride through the absurdities of modern wealth. Stéphanie’s rise through the crypto world and Thiago’s crumbling scams provide the perfect backdrop for a comedy that pokes fun at both the get-rich-quick mentality of cryptocurrency and the lengths people will go to maintain their facades.

Critics have hailed the film for its energetic pacing and unique mix of action and comedy. From car chases to romantic entanglements, the chemistry between Lyes and Marchal makes for an electrifying dynamic, bringing depth to what could have been just another light-hearted romp. However, for those familiar with the cryptocurrency space, the portrayal of crypto wealth as a breeding ground for manipulation and scams may feel a little exaggerated. While the film succeeds in creating a humorous and thrilling narrative, it lightly reinforces a common misconception that crypto is all about easy money and deceit.

Whether you’re a fan of action rom-coms or curious about the unpredictable world of cryptocurrency, All Time High delivers a fresh and fun look at the lengths people go to for love and money, even if it takes some liberties in depicting the crypto world."

As the protagonist deciphers a message embedded deep in blockchain code, her search for meaning becomes a descent into paranoia and danger — a metaphor for our digital age.","A tormented game developer’s recovery in the countryside is interrupted when she uncovers a mysterious message embedded in a cryptocurrency algorithm, launching a quest for answers which soon turns into a fight for her life.

To recover from workplace harassment at her game development job in the city, coder Cara Hammond has carved out a quiet life as an aspiring cryptominer in the rural California countryside. While working on a new algorithm, she discovers mysterious code embedded in the mining data. Her discovery spurs an investigation for the truth, which quickly turns into a fight for her life. Powerful players will go to any length to protect their secrets, and Cara already knows too much.

In Crypto Shadows, director James Fox takes us on a thrilling ride through a blend of tech-driven suspense and psychological horror, intertwining cryptocurrency with a deeper, sinister conspiracy. Set against the serene yet isolating backdrop of rural California, Cara’s discovery of a hidden message in a blockchain code escalates into a chilling mystery that goes far beyond the world of digital currencies.

The film explores the paranoia of a digital world that thrives on anonymity, where hidden forces manipulate global systems behind the scenes. As Cara dives deeper into her investigation, she uncovers layers of corruption involving high-stakes players willing to go to any length to protect their dark secrets.

Crypto Shadows reflects not only on the potential of blockchain technology but also its vulnerabilities. The movie touches on themes of power, control, and the ever-looming presence of surveillance in the digital age, which Cara must navigate to survive. At its core, the film reminds viewers that, while cryptocurrency offers freedom from traditional financial systems, it is not immune to exploitation by shadowy figures with vast resources.

As one of the few films tackling crypto from a thriller perspective, Crypto Shadows is unique in its portrayal of the tech-savvy protagonist who uses her coding skills to battle forces far more powerful than herself. It provides a gripping narrative that merges the world of technology with intense psychological tension, offering both a cautionary tale and an entertaining watch for crypto enthusiasts and suspense lovers alike.

NFT: What the Punk!,Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and crypto art subculture,relevant,2024,Documentary miniseries,France,1h 20min,"June 11, 2024",Hervé Martin-Delpierre,,,,"NFT: What the Punk! is a documentary series chronicling the creation of the CryptoPunks NFT collection and the wild early days of the crypto art market, through the eyes of its pioneers and critics"," This three-part docuseries explores how two Canadian programmers, Matt Hall and John Watkinson, spawned CryptoPunks – 10,000 free 8-bit NFT characters – and inadvertently ignited a crypto-art frenzy. The film follows the rise of NFTs from a niche experiment into a high-stakes art market, featuring interviews with the Larva Labs founders and early crypto artists. It also profiles artist Robness, an outspoken figure who rebelled against the financial speculation by literally burning a CryptoPunk as performance art. Through these personal stories, the series examines the convergence of art, technology, and finance in the NFT realm","NFT: What the Punk! provides an insider account of the crypto-art revolution’s beginnings. Episode 1 recounts how Hall and Watkinson launched CryptoPunks on Ethereum in 2017 as free collectibles, only to see them become wildly valuable a few years later. The series uses archival footage and interviews to show the “digital wild west” atmosphere of that era: a small community on Discord suddenly faced with an influx of speculators after mainstream media coverage drew attention to these pixelated punks. As NFT prices skyrocketed, Christie's auctioneers, tech entrepreneurs, and artists all converged, sensing they were at the forefront of a new art frontier.
Episode 2 and 3 delve into the boom-and-bust dynamics of the NFT market. The documentary highlights how the $69 million Beeple sale and celebrity NFT buys in 2021 supercharged a speculative mania that overshadowed the art. Through voices like Noah Davis (who led digital art at Christie’s) and collector Dan Polko, the film illustrates how CryptoPunks laid the groundwork for the Profile Picture (PFP) craze, inspiring projects like Bored Ape Yacht Club and countless copycats. As a counterpoint, What the Punk! follows ROBNESS – a CryptoArt veteran – who laments the commodification of a movement that started with underground, anti-establishment spirit. ROBNESS’s story, including his dramatic act of burning Punk #2317 in protest, injects a critical perspective on whether the NFT explosion was about art or just money.
Beyond recounting events, the series reflects on the cultural significance of NFTs. Director Hervé Martin-Delpierre (known for Daft Punk Unchained) spent three years unearthing the human stories behind the crypto hype. The film portrays the CryptoPunks creators not just as techies but as artists caught in a surreal “NFT bubble,” suddenly dealing with celebrity buyers and multimillion-dollar trades. It emphasizes the human element – how Hall and Watkinson navigated fame and fortune, and how early crypto artists persisted in pushing creative boundaries amid the gold rush. NFT: What the Punk! ultimately serves as a time capsule of a paradigm shift in art. It captures the ethos of a community that briefly believed in a decentralized art utopia, even as that utopia was overtaken by hype. By documenting this chapter of internet history with a critical eye, the series helps viewers understand how a “worthless” fad in the eyes of skeptics became a transformative movement – and asks whether digital art, like past subversive art forms, can earn lasting legitimacy once the dust settles"
How the World Went Ape$h!t,The Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and the broader NFT craze,relevant,2025,Feature documentary,USA,1h 26min,"July 31, 2025",Sharon Bordas,,,,How the World Went Ape$h!t is a tongue-in-cheek documentary retelling the NFT frenzy through the voices of the Bored Ape Yacht Club – literally having cartoon apes narrate the rise and crash of the NFT market,"This inventive film chronicles how NFT mania took hold and then went “apeshit.” It begins with the birth of Bored Ape Yacht Club in 2021, when a quirky collection of ape cartoons swiftly became the face of a speculative gold rush. Using a mix of interviews and satirical animated sequences, the documentary recounts the wild highs – celebrities buying cartoon apes for millions, crypto “degens” flaunting newfound wealth – and the crashing lows as the bubble burst. Uniquely, five BAYC avatar characters serve as storytellers on-screen, offering a playful “NFTs’ point of view” narration of events. Alongside them, real people from the scene (artists, collectors, influencers) reflect on the absurdity and humanity behind the hype. The result is both an insider history of an internet craze and a self-aware commentary on the line between innovation and insanity in the crypto world","How the World Went Ape$h!t takes viewers on a surreal ride through the NFT rollercoaster. The documentary opens by setting the stage in early 2021: a perfect storm of “financial speculation, creative opportunism and impulsive idealism” had swept pop culture into a frenzy. At the center was Bored Ape Yacht Club – a collection of 10,000 cartoon apes that unexpectedly became status symbols for celebrities and CEOs almost overnight. The film uses archival news clips of NFT auctions and exuberant social media posts to capture the zeitgeist. It then cleverly “enlists the aid of the very NFTs who lived it” – animated Bored Apes – to guide the narrative with humor and hindsight. These ape avatars recount how in mid-2021, everyone from rappers to athletes was clamoring to “join the club,” fueling a bubble where ugly monkey JPEGs sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Through their eyes, we see the joy of early adopters, the ridiculous excess (like yacht parties and Ape merch at its peak), and the foreshadowing signs of a crash.
In parallel, the film features candid interviews with key players in the saga. BAYC community members and crypto commentators describe the highs: the sense of belonging in an exclusive online club and the life-changing money made during the boom. But they also recount the lows: latecomers losing fortunes as NFT prices plummeted in 2022, scams and hacks proliferating, and the public backlash as “crypto bro culture” turned sour. The documentary covers notorious events like celebrity endorsements (e.g. Paris Hilton and Jimmy Fallon showing off apes on TV) and the subsequent market collapse that saw NFTs lose 90%+ of their value. By spotlighting these “highs and lows of this cultural moment,” How the World Went Ape$h!t paints a full picture of the NFT craze as both a product of 2020s internet culture and a speculative bubble reminiscent of past manias. Longtime crypto artists and skeptics in the film discuss how the hype overshadowed genuine innovation, echoing the film’s larger question: was this revolution in digital ownership sustainable, or just a flash in the pan?
Fittingly, the documentary doesn’t just talk about Web3 – it embodies it. Director Sharon Bordas and producer Jeff Hasler partnered with Stuff.io to premiere the movie as an NFT, literally making the film a collectible digital asset. In July 2025, instead of a traditional cinema release, 10,000 “mintable” copies of the movie were sold to fans on the blockchain. This novel distribution model (the first of its kind for Fremantle) allowed buyers to truly own, trade, or resell their copy of the film – echoing the NFT ethos of provable ownership. One lucky minter even won an actual Bored Ape NFT, #7112, as a prize, blurring the line between subject and promotion. Bordas has stated that this direct-to-community approach was about practicing what the film preaches: if NFTs promise to empower creators and consumers, why not use them to deliver the story itself? The stunt generated buzz and underscored the documentary’s theme that the medium of blockchain can disrupt not just art, but filmmaking too.
In summary, How the World Went Ape$h!t serves as both a chronicle and critique of the NFT era. It captures a bizarre chapter of crypto history when “everyone went ape,” contextualizing it with humor and hindsight. By letting cartoon apes and real insiders share the spotlight, the film humanizes a topic often dismissed as purely speculative. It invites viewers to marvel at how “a $3,000,000 JPEG” could exist – and to reflect on what lasting cultural impact, if any, that phenomenon will have now that the hype has subsided. In doing so, the documentary provides an accessible entry point into understanding the Web3 mania for those who lived through it and a record for those who will inevitably ask: what the heck was that about?"
Let’s Form Group: PizzaDAO ,Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and crypto communities,relevant,2023,Short Documentary,USA,7min 46secs,March 2023,Thobey Campion,,,,Let’s Form Group: PizzaDAO is a brief documentary profiling a crypto community of pizza lovers who believe pizza should be free – and who use NFTs and a DAO to fund pizza parties in hundreds of cities,"This upbeat short film offers a day-in-the-life look at PizzaDAO, a decentralized collective of artists, developers, and volunteers united by one quirky mission: “Pizza should be free”. Filmed in Philadelphia, the episode follows PizzaDAO founder Snax (Sam Weinrott) as he prepares for the annual Global Pizza Party on Bitcoin Pizza Day. We see how PizzaDAO uses crypto fundraising – notably proceeds from their Rare Pizzas NFT art collection – to bankroll thousands of free pizzas around the world. In candid interviews and scene-setting shots (from local pizzerias to Discord chats), the short documentary highlights the community spirit behind the tech: it’s less about blockchain buzzwords and more about sharing food, joy, and culture across borders, powered by a DAO’s collective effort. Despite its brevity, the film captures the essence of an optimistic Web3 subculture, where internet friends coordinate to do something wholesome in real life.","Let’s Form Group: PizzaDAO is part of a seven-episode documentary series by Collab.Land that shines a light on the human side of Web3 communities. In this episode, the spotlight is on PizzaDAO – a global decentralized community perhaps best known for throwing free pizza parties in celebration of Bitcoin Pizza Day (May 22). The film introduces us to Snax, the energetic leader of PizzaDAO, as he explains the origin of the project during the NFT boom of 2021. What started with selling cartoon “pizza” NFTs (created by 300 artists worldwide) turned into a treasury that PizzaDAO has used to give away more than $1 million worth of pizza across 75+ countries in just a few years. The documentary shows Snax visiting a local pizza shop in Philadelphia, coordinating with volunteers via Collab.Land (which verifies members by their NFT tokens), and preparing for the big global event. Through these snapshots, viewers get a sense of how a DAO operates on the ground: decisions made collectively in Discord, funds distributed to organizers in different cities, and a blend of crypto lingo with real-world logistics (like finding enough dough and cheese for thousands of slices!).
Even in its short runtime, the film conveys the scale and ethos of PizzaDAO’s undertaking. We glimpse maps of the world dotted with PizzaDAO events – from New York to Nairobi – emphasizing the global reach of this community-driven party. There are scenes of diverse groups of people coming together over pizza, illustrating what Snax describes as the core idea: using crypto to “empower communities around the world to celebrate…with joy, generosity and shared meals,” removing barriers between people. The episode subtly touches on how blockchain makes this possible: by using NFTs and tokens, PizzaDAO creates a treasury that anyone can contribute to and anyone can draw from, as long as it’s for the mission of free pizza. It’s a real-life example of token-gated community – which is fitting, since Collab.Land (the series presenter) is the very tool that manages PizzaDAO’s token-based membership on Discord. The film doesn’t get technical, but viewers see glimpses of the Collab.Land interface and how members prove they hold a Rare Pizza NFT to join the crew. This underscores a key point: technology is simply an enabler here, allowing a fun idea to scale into a worldwide movement.
What makes this mini-doc compelling is its optimism and human focus, aligning with Collab.Land co-founder Anjali Young’s goal of “elevating the crypto narrative” beyond scams and speculation. In interview snippets, Snax and others express genuine excitement about giving away pizza as an act of kindness, using the tools of Web3 to organize trust and funds among people who mostly have never met in person. The film shows that while many crypto projects in 2021 were about making a quick buck, communities like PizzaDAO were “aligning incentives to solve real-world problems” – in this case, food and fellowship. There’s a brief reflection on the symbolism of Bitcoin Pizza Day (the holiday commemorating the first real-world bitcoin transaction buying pizzas in 2010) and how PizzaDAO is turning a story often cited as a crypto punchline (10,000 BTC for two pizzas) into an annual global celebration of generosity. By the episode’s end, when pizzas are coming out of ovens and smiles abound, the message lands clearly: crypto can be about community. PizzaDAO’s experiment may be lighthearted, but it demonstrates a template of using DAOs to bring people together – a counterpoint to the narrative of crypto as merely speculative tokens.
As part of the “Let’s Form Group” series, this short was first screened at ETHDenver (a major Ethereum conference) in early 2023 to an enthusiastic Web3 audience. Subsequent episodes in the series cover other communities (like Rug Radio and SpankChain), each illustrating different facets of decentralized culture. The PizzaDAO episode, being among the first released, helped set the tone of the series by showcasing the “human impact & spirit of the crypto scene”. Its approachable storytelling – minimal jargon, vibrant visuals of pizza and people – makes it accessible even to viewers who might be skeptical of crypto. In fact, many might come away more interested in the community aspect than the technology itself, which is exactly the point. The Collab.Land team intended these films to serve as “historical artifacts of this time” that future generations can watch to understand why people in the 2020s were excited about Web3. Let’s Form Group: PizzaDAO succeeds in capturing a positive snapshot of that excitement. It’s a feel-good micro-documentary that leaves you hungry – for both pizza and the hopeful sense of global community that was a hallmark of the early DAO movement."
Unbankable,BTC adoption in Africa,relevant,2025,Documentary,Canada / South Africa,1h 10min,May 2025,Luke Willms,,UNBANKABLE - Official Teaser,,"A thought-provoking documentary that travels across Africa to examine how people are accessing finance without traditional banks, from informal savings circles and mobile money to Bitcoin experiments – ultimately asking whether “Africa can save the West” by modeling a more resilient, community-based financial future","Filmed over seven years in seven countries, UNBANKABLE is an eye-opening journey through markets and villages where conventional banking fails to reach. Director Luke Willms – who worked at an African microfinance NGO – uses his personal journey as a narrative thread: initially a believer in microloans, he becomes disillusioned with the limits of top-down aid and sets out to discover how people are innovating on their own. The documentary takes viewers from women-run savings groups in rural Uganda (who create community “banks” using lockboxes and trust) to mobile money agents in Kenya’s slums, to Bitcoin communities like Bitcoin Ekasi in South Africa’s townships. Each segment reveals a common theme: traditional banks and NGOs have often left these people “unbankable,” so they have built their own solutions – sometimes centuries-old (like chamas or rotating savings clubs), sometimes cutting-edge (like using BTC via SMS). Willms interviews locals in their native languages (subtitled), giving them center stage to explain the challenges they face: hyperinflation in Zimbabwe, exorbitant remittance fees for migrant workers, or predatory lending by microfinance institutions. Then he highlights the grassroots alternatives: for instance, in Nigeria, entrepreneurs have set up circular economies where farmers and merchants trade with Bitcoin to avoid currency devaluation; in South Africa, the Bitcoin Ekasi project is teaching youth about sats as a savings tool. The film’s tone is hopeful – it spotlights resilience and ingenuity over poverty.
","UNBANKABLE is both a critique of the status quo and a celebration of bottom-up innovation. Luke Willms begins the film with a confession: “I went to Africa to document a microfinance success story, but what I found challenged everything I assumed”. Initially, we see footage of Willms in 2015 working for an NGO in Malawi, proudly touting a microcredit program. But as defaults rise and some borrowers fall into worse poverty, he questions if the Western fintech playbook really fits local contexts. This catalyst sets him off on a seven-year quest captured by the film. In one powerful sequence, UNBANKABLE visits a village in Kenya where a group of women participate in a “merry-go-round” savings scheme: each member contributes a bit weekly and one member takes the lump sum in rotation. With no bank involved, this system runs purely on trust and social bonds – and it’s worked for generations. The film juxtaposes this with an interview of a local bank manager who admits that banks consider such small, irregular savers not worth their time. “The irony,” Willms narrates, “is that these informal groups have near 100% repayment rates – far better than our microfinance project ever did.”. Moving to urban Africa, UNBANKABLE dives into mobile money’s impact: in Nairobi’s bustling streets, we meet people who leapfrogged past bank accounts straight to M-Pesa on their phones. One young motorcycle taxi driver describes how he secures loans via a mobile app based on his phone bill history, not a credit score – a novel path to credit for the formerly invisible. The documentary emphasizes how technology like cell phones and Bitcoin are converging with traditional community practices. For example, in Ghana, a chapter shows villagers using a blockchain-based app to manage communal savings, blending old trust networks with new tech for transparency. Perhaps the film’s most striking claim comes toward the end: Willms suggests that these grassroots systems in the Global South might hold answers for financial resilience that even wealthy countries could learn from. In a segment titled “Can Africa save the West?”, the film presents a bold thesis: Western financial systems, bloated with debt and dependent on endless money printing, could find a sustainability model in the decentralized, trust-based approaches flourishing in places like Kenya and Senegal. Bitcoin is presented not as a magic bullet, but as one tool among many – yet an important one for preserving value. We see Argentine and Zimbabwean Bitcoiners explain how crypto has helped them survive when their national currencies collapsed. The film’s narrative builds to an inspiring conclusion at a community center in Pretoria, where Bitcoin is used alongside local exchange trading systems: “Here,” Willms notes, “finance is not something done to the people by institutions – it’s done by the people, for each other.” The final scenes at the 2025 Bitcoin Film Festival show Willms and some of his documentary subjects answering audience questions – proving that these once-marginal ideas now spark global conversation. UNBANKABLE has received acclaim for its humanizing storytelling and for reframing the narrative around financial inclusion. Rather than focus on statistics, it lets viewers travel into homes and markets, meet grandmothers turned bankers, hackers turned humanitarian builders, and question the assumption that only formal institutions can provide stability. By 2025, as debates rage about CBDCs and banking access, UNBANKABLE stands as a timely reminder that sometimes the most powerful financial innovations aren’t coming from Wall Street or Silicon Valley at all – they’re coming from the streets of Kampala, Lagos, and Caracas, where necessity and creativity meet"
Revolución Bitcoin,BTC in spanish language,relevant,2025,Documentary,Spain / Colombia,1h 20min,June 2024,Juan Pablo Mejía,,REVOLUCIÓN BITCOIN | El DOCUMENTAL sobre BITCOIN en español | Campaña de crowdfunding,,"A Spanish-language documentary exploring Bitcoin’s transformative impact in Latin America and Spain, featuring real stories of people using Bitcoin to combat hyperinflation, evade financial censorship, and rethink the future of money – effectively a crash course in the “revolución Bitcoin” sweeping the Hispanic world","REVOLUCIÓN BITCOIN serves as an accessible introduction to Bitcoin’s promise through a Latin American lens. The film is structured in chapters that follow the flow of money: it starts with a primer on “the origins of money and why it fails” (filmed in Spain, with experts explaining how fiat money lost its gold backing and became prone to political manipulation). Then it moves to real-world case studies: Argentina’s fight against inflation is a major segment, with Argentine residents recounting memories of the 2001 peso crisis and el corralito (bank freeze) – one interviewee says, “I lived through the corralito… we couldn’t access our own money”. These personal accounts set the stage for why Bitcoin’s fixed 21 million supply appeals to many Argentines today. In Venezuela, the filmmakers show how Bitcoin mining and trading became lifelines during the bolívar’s collapse – a young Venezuelan describes feeding his family via Bitcoin remittances when Western Union pulled out. The documentary also examines El Salvador’s bold Bitcoin experiment (though largely from an outsider perspective, since it was filmed pre-2025): it shows footage of President Bukele’s announcement making BTC legal tender and includes interviews with Salvadoran citizens split on the issue. Meanwhile in Spain, Revolución Bitcoin spotlights the growing crypto community: scenes at events like La Bitconf (with enthusiastic crowds chanting “¡Bitcoin, libertad!”) demonstrate how this movement has become a social phenomenon, not just a financial one","This documentary feels like both a rallying cry and an educational journey. Juan Pablo Mejía, the director and narrator, is a well-known Bitcoin educator, and he uses a clear, folksy Spanish style to break down concepts throughout the film. For example, in one scene he’s standing in Madrid’s Puerta del Sol holding up a €20 bill and a physical bitcoin token, asking passersby: “¿En cuál confías más – en este papel o en un código abierto que nadie puede manipular?” (“Which do you trust more – this paper, or an open code no one can manipulate?”). These man-on-the-street moments give insight into the skepticism and curiosity among everyday people. Revolución Bitcoin also doesn’t shy from controversy: it addresses common criticisms, like “Is Bitcoin just used by criminals?” and “What about its energy use?”, bringing in Spanish tech experts to debunk misconceptions in simple terms (one expert explains that CBDCs – central bank digital currencies – will actually give governments more control, and contrasts that with Bitcoin’s decentralized nature). Each chapter of the film builds on the idea that Bitcoin is not just an investment; it’s a social movement. In the Censorship chapter, for instance, a Polish immigrant in Spain tells how he donated to a protest via Bitcoin after banks were pressured to block funds – highlighting Bitcoin’s role as “censorship-resistant money”. The narrative crescendos with the theme that Spanish-speaking crypto users often repeat: “No es sobre hacerte rico rápido; es sobre la libertad financiera” (“It’s not about getting rich quick; it’s about financial freedom”). Visually, Revolución Bitcoin keeps things lively. It intercuts talking-head interviews with dynamic animations (e.g. a cartoon Satoshi locking a padlock on the blockchain) and even a few meme-worthy clips, giving it a grassroots, YouTube-doc aesthetic. The premiere in Madrid’s Cine Paz on June 19, 2024 is shown briefly – a packed theater of crypto enthusiasts applauding – underscoring that this film was made “by the community, for the community”. After its theatrical run (which also included showings in Mexico City and Buenos Aires), the team released it online for free on January 3, 2025, timing it with the anniversary of Bitcoin’s first block to symbolize the spreading revolution. Since then, the documentary has served as a entry-point for Spanish speakers curious about Bitcoin: it’s been praised for explaining complex concepts in everyday language and for showcasing relatable stories – like the Argentine father who says Bitcoin saved his family’s savings from 50% annual inflation, or the young Salvadoran who after initially fearing Bitcoin now uses it daily via the Chivo wallet. Critics note that the film leans pro-Bitcoin and doesn’t feature many dissenting voices, making it more propaganda than balanced journalism. But as Juan en Cripto said in a post-release Q&A: “Claro que es parcial – es el lado de la gente común que por fin tiene una herramienta financiera.” (“Of course it’s partial – it’s the side of common people who finally have a financial tool [for themselves].”) In essence, Revolución Bitcoin captures the optimism and fervor of the Hispanic Bitcoin community circa 2024, documenting a chapter of the financial revolution in which Latin Americans and Spaniards are not just participants but protagonists"
Bitcoin Rising – South Africa’s Path to Freedom,BTC adoption in Africa,relevant,2025,Documentary,South Africa,45min,September 2025,Jonas Nilsson,,Bitcoin Rising – South Africa’s Path to Freedom,,"A grassroots documentary showcasing ordinary South Africans “opting out” of the crumbling fiat system by embracing Bitcoin, from a township surfing school that pays kids in BTC to a rural farming village running on solar power and Bitcoin – painting an inspiring portrait of economic self-sovereignty in the face of currency collapse","This 45-minute film tells two parallel stories set in South Africa against the backdrop of a deteriorating national currency (the rand). The first story follows Bitcoin Ekasi in a township near Mossel Bay: here, a local surf instructor and coach has introduced Bitcoin to help kids and shopkeepers save in something more stable than rand. We see kids learning about sats after their surf lessons – one young boy grins as he scans a Lightning QR code to receive 50 sats as a reward, and a tuck shop owner explains that she now prices candy in sats because “the price of bread went up 20% this year, but sats keep their value”. The second story is set in the coastal village of Witsand, but it focuses on an affluent community of “traditional” (predominantly white) South Africans who are also turning to Bitcoin – not out of immediate need, but out of a desire for financial independence and as a hedge against what they see as government mismanagement. Scenes include a beachside farmers market where vendors accept BTC via mobile apps, and interviews with an older couple who converted their solar energy surplus into satoshis (using Bitcoin mining). The documentary emphasizes the contrast: one community is poor and uses Bitcoin out of necessity, the other is well-off and uses it out of principle – yet both see Bitcoin as a “path to freedom” while the fiat system “crumbles around them”","Bitcoin Rising – South Africa’s Path to Freedom opens with news clips from 2023-2024: we hear South African newscasters lamenting the rand reaching record lows, rolling blackouts hitting businesses, and youth unemployment soaring. A narrator states, “In a nation where ‘money doesn’t work’ for many, some are finding another way.” The film then splits into its two narrative threads. The township segment introduces us to Coach Luthando, a former street kid turned surfer who founded Bitcoin Ekasi. Filmmaker Jonas Nilsson uses a cinéma vérité approach – the camera follows Luthando as he visits corner shops persuading them to try a Bitcoin payment. One powerful scene shows him explaining Bitcoin to an elderly shopkeeper in Xhosa: he compares it to “digital gold that your government can’t touch”, and she nods recalling how her life savings were wiped out in 2001 by bank failures (this ties in, as an on-screen caption notes, to South Africa’s own history of inflation and bank runs in the late apartheid era). As weeks pass, we see a small circular economy form: kids earn sats for doing community chores or attending extra tutoring; they spend sats at the shop for school supplies; the shopkeeper then uses some sats to buy fresh produce from a farmer down the road. It’s modest, but it works – and importantly, the participants express a newfound hope. One teenage girl says in an interview, “For the first time, I feel what I save might actually be worth something in the future.” This is juxtaposed with a grim statistic on-screen about youth unemployment and lack of banking access in townships (many can’t open bank accounts due to lack of formal ID or minimum deposit – hence they leapfrog directly to Bitcoin wallets on donated smartphones).
Switching to Witsand, the tone and visuals shift: aerial drone shots of a scenic, off-grid eco-village by the Indian Ocean, where residents have voluntarily embraced a Bitcoin standard. We meet Pieter and Marietjie, retirees who run a bed-and-breakfast on solar power and accept only Bitcoin from their guests. Their motivations are philosophical – Pieter shows the filmmaker his coin collection and equates Bitcoin to “digital Krugerrands” representing true ownership. We also visit a local fishing co-op where fishermen are paid in BTC via an SMS-based Lightning service (an alternative for those without smartphones). This community’s story highlights freedom from the legacy banking system as a choice: one resident says he pulled all his money out of South African banks after a corruption scandal and put some into Bitcoin, explaining “I trust math and code more than politicians now.” Both communities are radically different, yet the documentary draws parallels: it emphasizes how the fiat monetary system is failing both rich and poor in South Africa, just in different ways – inflation and exclusion for the poor, negative real yields and distrust for the well-off. A recurring motif is the idea of “opting out”: Coach Luthando uses that phrase when he talks to parents in the township (to convince them Bitcoin isn’t a scam but a way to opt out of constant price hikes), and a Witsand community leader uses it when describing their local economy experiment separate from government control.
The documentary is not just rosy – it shows challenges too. In the township, some merchants are initially skeptical or the internet goes down making Bitcoin payments hard (prompting a volunteer to set up a mesh Wi-Fi network). In Witsand, an older resident admits “I still cash out some Bitcoin each month for rand, because realistically we can’t pay electricity or rates in BTC yet.” These frank admissions lend credibility. Toward the end, Jonas Nilsson inserts some context: an economist from Cape Town University gives a brief analysis with charts showing the rand’s 90% loss of value vs USD over two decades, arguing that South Africans have strong incentive to find alternatives (gold, dollars, or now Bitcoin). The final minutes circle back to the title – “South Africa’s Path to Freedom.” The narrator suggests that while Bitcoin alone won’t solve all socio-economic issues, it’s empowering individuals and communities to reclaim some agency: “In the township, they no longer wait for government aid that might never come. In the village, they’re building the future they want to see. Both believe freedom – financial and personal – starts with controlling their own money.” The closing shot shows Coach Luthando at sunrise, leading his surf students in a cheer, “Bitcoin!”, the kids laughing and echoing “Beeet-coin!” with exuberance as they run into the waves. It’s an uplifting conclusion that has left many viewers around the world inspired – in fact, within weeks of its YouTube release, volunteer translators added subtitles in 5 languages, spreading the message that Bitcoin’s promise of freedom has truly gone global. (As one reviewer noted, Bitcoin Rising is “the story of ordinary people finding hope in an extraordinary technology”"
Biggest Heist Ever,biggest crypto heist ever,relevant,2024,Documentary,USA,1h 25min,December 2024,Chris Smith,,,,"A Netflix documentary that unravels the “Biggest Heist Ever” in crypto, following the quirky married couple behind the Bitfinex hack laundering scheme – featuring rap videos, hidden USB sticks, and an FBI sting – in a stranger-than-fiction tale of digital crime","Biggest Heist Ever tells the almost unbelievable story of how Heather Morgan (an aspiring rapper and Forbes writer) and Ilya Lichtenstein (a tech entrepreneur) ended up with 119,754 stolen bitcoins from the 2016 Bitfinex hack – and how their attempt to launder those funds ultimately led to their capture. Directed by Chris Smith (known for Fyre and Tiger King), the film blends traditional documentary elements (interviews with federal agents like IRS Special Agent Chris Janczewski\, prosecutors, and crypto experts) with cinematic re-enactments and Morgan’s own absurd rap footage to paint a full picture of the case. The tone is at times comedic – Morgan’s alter ego “Razzlekhan” is shown rapping nonsensically about Wall Street, a key example of how truth can be stranger than fiction – and at other times, it’s a high-stakes thriller detailing the painstaking investigation. The documentary covers how blockchain analytics traced the hacked coins across the web for years, until agents found the keys in Lichtenstein’s cloud storage in 2022. It also delves into the couple’s psyche: Heather’s desire for fame (via her wild YouTube persona) contrasted with Ilya’s low-profile scheming. Throughout, Biggest Heist Ever highlights the cat-and-mouse dynamic between criminals and law enforcement in the crypto age.
","In Biggest Heist Ever, director Chris Smith delivers a gripping narrative that feels equal parts heist caper, character study, and cautionary tale about hubris in the digital age. The documentary sets the stage by recounting the Bitfinex hack of August 2016 – a breach that rocked the cryptocurrency world when nearly 120,000 BTC vanished in an instant. While the hack itself remains somewhat mysterious, the film’s focus is on what happened after: how the stolen coins sat largely untouched for years until, in early 2022, law enforcement made a breakthrough. The filmmakers secure extensive access to those who cracked the case. IRS agent Chris Janczewski, for example, walks viewers through the “follow the money” blockchain analysis that led them to a list of wallet addresses and ultimately to a New York City apartment door. There, agents encountered Heather Morgan and Ilya Lichtenstein – a pair that, as the film shows, hardly fit the stereotype of international masterminds. Heather, seen in the documentary’s found footage rapping in gold lamé pants and calling herself “Crocodile of Wall Street,” comes off as equal parts eccentric and naïve, pursuing social media fame even as she allegedly held keys to billions in stolen Bitcoin. Ilya is depicted as the quieter partner, a tech nerd-turned-“serial scammer” who, as one interviewee notes, “forced his way into Silicon Valley” only to resort to crime when legitimate paths faltered. The film expertly interweaves humorous elements – such as scenes detailing how Heather baked cupcakes and carried on normal life while literally sitting on a crypto fortune – with the serious ramifications of their actions. One sequence reenacts the day of their arrest: agents swarm the couple’s apartment, Lichtenstein nervously asks to grab his coat (which hides a USB stick with part of the keys), but the ruse fails and they’re caught. Biggest Heist Ever also addresses broader themes: the “moral ambiguity of early crypto culture”, the temptation of untraceable wealth, and the role of government in a decentralized financial system. The documentary’s title is apt – not only did Morgan and Lichtenstein allegedly try to pull off the biggest theft in crypto history, but the film suggests that the true heist is the mainstream narrative they spun. They weren’t criminal masterminds in the traditional sense; rather, they were opportunists who believed crypto’s anonymity made them untouchable. The film’s climax underscores how that belief crumbled – through a combination of old-fashioned investigative work and the immutable transparency of blockchain. By its end, Biggest Heist Ever leaves viewers marveling at the bizarre twists of the case (for instance, that law enforcement recovered 94,000 BTC – worth $3.6 billion – from the couple’s accounts in a single swoop) and reflecting on the lessons learned. As one expert in the film quips, “crime in the age of crypto isn’t bank robbers with guns – it’s keyboard jockeys with passphrases, and sometimes they’re more bumbling than you’d expect.” This Netflix documentary, with its high production values and compelling storytelling, has been well-received for turning a dense crypto crime story into a highly entertaining and educational experience"

Bitconned ,True crime crypto scam,relevant,2024,Documentary,USA,1h 35min,January 2024,Bryan Storkel,,,,A debaucherous true story of three young men who schemed to cash in on the 2017 crypto boom with a fake Bitcoin card startup – scamming $32 million from investors – until their lies caught up with them,"Bitconned plays out like The Wolf of Wall Street meets crypto. It follows Ray Trapani, a Long Island hustler who “always wanted to be a criminal” (his own words). In 2017, as Bitcoin’s price surged, Ray and two buddies (Sam Sharma and Robert Farkas) cook up Centra Tech, a startup promising a cryptocurrency debit card backed by Visa/Mastercard – a product they had no ability to actually create. The documentary, with Ray’s cooperation, recounts how they built the scam: they fabricated a CEO on LinkedIn, paid celebrities like Floyd Mayweather and DJ Khaled to endorse their ICO, and enticed thousands of investors in the frenzy of the ICO boom. For a while, it worked – money poured in (over $32 million) and the trio partied in Miami with Lamborghinis and yachts (scenes of their wild spending are shown). But doubts and scrutiny mounted: skeptical journalists (like The Verge’s Jordan Pearson) started digging, the SEC took notice, and cracks in Centra’s story became public.
","The film is structured around Ray Trapani’s candid narration, giving an insider perspective rarely seen in crypto fraud cases. He’s charismatic, unrepentant at times, and disturbingly frank about the allure of scamming. Through interviews with his family and former friends, we see another side – Ray as a product of his environment, with big dreams and blurred morals. Bitconned also brings in law enforcement agents and reporters who ultimately exposed Centra Tech as one of the first major crypto frauds of that era. Tension escalates as Sharma and Farkas consider cutting Ray out, and Ray, feeling cornered, contemplates drastic measures to keep the con afloat. The climax recounts the FBI sting and arrests in 2018, which made headlines as a cautionary tale of ICO excess. The documentary’s tone is flashy and fast-paced – much like the scam itself – but also reflective by the end. It notes that all three co-founders went to prison, and it draws a line from Centra Tech’s implosion to the broader reckoning on ICOs (and how regulations tightened afterward). By showcasing how easily greed and gullibility mixed in the Wild West of 2017 crypto, Bitconned offers a sobering lesson: if something in crypto sounds too good to be true, it probably is. (This story was compelling enough that after the film’s release, its producers expanded it into a podcast series, “Creating a Con,” to delve even deeper.)"
The Missing Cryptoqueen: Dead or Alive?,Crypto crime investigation,relevant,2024,Documentary,UK,29min,June 2024,Storm Theunissen,,,,Investigative documentary examining the disappearance of Ruja Ignatova – the notorious “Cryptoqueen” behind the $4 billion OneCoin scam – and probing whether she is dead or alive,"This BBC World Service/Panorama film revisits the OneCoin cryptocurrency fraud and its mastermind, Dr. Ruja Ignatova, years after she vanished. Through interviews with law enforcement and insiders, The Missing Cryptoqueen: Dead or Alive? explores new clues and theories about Ignatova’s fate, including alleged links to organized crime and rumors of her murder. The 2024 documentary updates the infamous case – which put Ignatova on the FBI’s Most Wanted list – and asks whether the so-called Cryptoqueen is still alive, all while highlighting the Ponzi-like nature of OneCoin and its victims’ quest for justice","The Missing Cryptoqueen: Dead or Alive? is a BBC investigative documentary that chronicles the seven-year hunt for Dr. Ruja Ignatova, founder of the fraudulent OneCoin cryptocurrency. Ignatova promised a financial revolution but instead defrauded investors of an estimated $4.5 billion before disappearing in late 2017. The film, part of the Panorama series, follows journalist Jamie Bartlett and a BBC Eye investigations team as they track new leads on Ignatova’s whereabouts. It exposes how OneCoin’s blockchain was a sham and examines theories that Ignatova may have been protected – or harmed – by powerful criminal associates. With Ignatova now among the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted fugitives, the documentary balances speculation with evidence: it reports allegations that she was murdered by a Bulgarian crime boss, but also recounts unconfirmed sightings of her around the world. The film’s tone is both suspenseful and cautionary, illustrating the outdated technology and deceit behind OneCoin’s fake cryptocurrency while drawing parallels to ongoing crypto scams. By the end, viewers gain insight into the scale of the OneCoin con, the tenacity of investigators, and the lingering mystery – is the “Cryptoqueen” still alive, or has her criminal empire met a deadly end? The documentary’s exploration of OneCoin’s collapse and Ignatova’s vanishing act remains highly relevant as a warning about unchecked crypto hype and fraud, even as the industry’s technology and regulations have evolved since the scam’s heyday."
My Trust In You Is Broken,BTCPay Server ,relevant,2024,Documentary,International,42min,April 2024,Parker Worthington,,,,"A community-driven documentary that revisits Bitcoin’s 2017 civil war over block sizes and SegWit, told through the eyes of developer Nicolas Dorier who, upon losing faith in a major payment company (“My trust in you is broken”), built BTCPay Server – a free, open alternative – altering Bitcoin’s merchant landscape and embodying the “Don’t Trust, Verify” spirit","MY TRUST IN YOU IS BROKEN serves as both a historical recount and an inspiring origin story for an open-source project. The film sets the stage by explaining the 2017 SegWit2x saga: via succinct animations and news clips, viewers are reminded how a group of large Bitcoin companies and miners attempted to force a protocol change (a block size increase + SegWit) – and how this led to a philosophical clash within Bitcoin’s community about decentralization vs. corporate influence. Nicolas Dorier, a soft-spoken French developer in Japan, is introduced as an unlikely hero of this drama. Through interviews and archival footage (like Nicolas speaking at a tiny Bitcoin meetup in Tokyo circa 2016), the doc shows his evolution from a BitPay integration developer to a vocal critic. The heart of the film is Nicolas’s decision in mid-2017 – disillusioned by BitPay’s support of the contentious SegWit2x fork and its attempt to push users onto a alternative software – to tweet “My trust in you is broken, I shall make you obsolete” aimed at BitPay. The documentary uses this tweet as a narrative pivot: from that break in trust springs the creation of BTCPay Server. We see how within weeks, Dorier indeed started coding frantically to create an open-source, self-hosted payment processor so that Bitcoin merchants would never have to rely on a third-party like BitPay again. The film follows him and a ragtag group of global contributors (some pseudonymous) over the months as they hack together the first BTCPay release – often showing late-night coding sessions and Slack chat excerpts with messages like “We have to get this out before the SegWit2x fork!”.
","For many inside the Bitcoin community, the Block Size War of 2017 is stuff of legend; My Trust In You Is Broken ambitiously attempts to convey that drama to a broader audience, through the personal lens of one developer’s journey. The documentary opens with a montage of corporate conference footage: smiling executives of big Bitcoin companies in early 2017 talking about “scaling solutions” – then cuts to Twitter screenshots with angry debates and the Bitcoin subreddit on fire with memes of “NO2X”. This effectively sets up the conflict. Key figures lay out the stakes in interviews: Adam Back describes SegWit2x as a “corporate takeover attempt”, while an archival clip of a BitPay spokesperson from 2017 expresses they only wanted “to do what’s best for Bitcoin’s growth.”. Nicolas Dorier’s soft voice then narrates from off-camera: “I was working with BitPay’s API for my projects. When they sided with NYA (New York Agreement), I felt betrayed – they weren’t listening to users or running consensus code, they tried to dictate rules.”
From here, the film goes into “hero’s journey” mode. Nicolas, depicted as a quiet, almost reluctant hero, nonetheless takes that famous Twitter oath (the tweet is dramatized with on-screen text and a typing sound effect). We then follow him building BTCPay. The film smartly interweaves actual archive from Bitcoin Twitter and GitHub – e.g., it shows a GitHub commit log from Nicolas on August 19, 2017, with the message “First commit, BTCPayServer” – alongside face-to-face interviews with BTCPay contributors describing the chaotic excitement of those days. One contributor (Rockstar Developer, masked in a hoodie to maintain pseudonymity) recalls, “None of us were paid, we just knew it had to be done. We’d chant ‘This is #No2X’ while coding.” There’s a tension between the urgency (the SegWit2x fork was scheduled for November 2017, essentially a countdown in the narrative) and the scrappiness of their effort – at one point Nicolas laughs that “I wrote some of the worst spaghetti code of my life at 3 AM, but it worked!”.
The climax of the film is the November 2017 showdown: the SegWit2x fork gets called off last-minute due to lack of consensus (the film shows the actual email from Mike Belshe announcing cancellation). Simultaneously, BTCPay Server gets its first real-world demo around that time – the documentary includes footage from a small Bitcoin meetup where Nicolas and Cøbra (Bitcoin.org co-owner, who supported the project) demonstrate BTCPay’s basic invoice screen, to cheers from the crowd. This dual victory – Bitcoin avoiding a split and an open alternative rising – is portrayed triumphantly, with a montage of tweets praising BTCPay (one tweet from 2018 by Andreas Antonopoulos calls BTCPay “one of Bitcoin’s most important projects”) and scenes of merchants adopting it. For instance, a cafe owner in Slovenia is shown using BTCPay on a tablet, expressing, “Now I process BTC with no middleman fees, it’s amazing.”
The latter part of the documentary addresses the legacy and broader meaning. Nicolas, in a reflective interview segment (filmed in 2023, sitting at his desk with his toddler on his lap), says “I didn’t set out to start a movement, I just couldn’t stand the trust broken. But BTCPay became bigger than me.”. We see how BTCPay grew into a global project – the film notes it has over 100 contributors by 2020, integrations with Lightning Network, etc. But importantly, it circles back to the theme of trustlessness. A title card reminds viewers of Bitcoin’s mantra “Don’t Trust, Verify,” and Parker Worthington (the director) narrates that Dorier’s story epitomizes that ethos: when trust was broken, he replaced trust with open-source code. The documentary closes on an emotional beat at the 2024 Bitcoin Film Festival premiere: Nicolas Dorier receives a standing ovation from the audience (footage shows him a bit bashful on stage), and the festival awards My Trust In You Is Broken the “Golden Rabbit” for best short documentary. In voiceover, Nicolas dedicates the award to “everyone who keeps Bitcoin free by building, not by complaining.” The final scene has the credits interspersed with a quote from his hero Satoshi: “Governments are good at cutting off the heads of centrally controlled networks... but pure P2P networks can hold their own.” – implicitly comparing BitPay (a central head) to BTCPay (a headless network).
Reception in the Bitcoin community has been glowing – many see the film as documenting a vital chapter of Bitcoin’s decentralized spirit. Even those who weren’t in the 2017 fight can grasp the significance through this narrative. For a general audience, the film also serves as an engaging David vs. Goliath tech story with a positive message about open-source triumphing over corporate control. It ensures factual accuracy by citing sources (the BTCPay blog and Bitcoin Magazine articles are referenced in on-screen text). Overall, My Trust In You Is Broken is a concise yet powerful chronicle of how one developer’s principled stand helped shape Bitcoin’s future – reinforcing in 2025 that Bitcoin’s resilience comes from people willing to say “If you don’t do it right, we’ll do it ourselves”"

Bitcoiners,Grassroots Bitcoin movement in Texas,relevant,2024,Documentary,USA,1h 26min,April 2024,Rob Johnson,,,,An independent documentary following Texas Bitcoin enthusiasts (“plebs”) in their mission to prove Bitcoin’s power to save America,"Bitcoiners offers an inside look at a passionate community of die-hard Bitcoin devotees in Texas. Filmed over 2021–2023, it follows everyday people (“plebs”) living the Bitcoin life and interweaves interviews with well-known Bitcoin voices. The film highlights their almost religious conviction that Bitcoin can fix societal problems in America, making complex technical ideas personal and accessible.","This feature-length documentary chronicles the personal journeys and convictions of a group of Texan Bitcoiners during the early 2020s. Instead of focusing on technical details or expert theory, Bitcoiners centers on human stories – like that of Kyle Murphy, who lives in a van to lower expenses and build a Bitcoin startup, embodying the lengths to which believers will go. Director Rob Johnson eschews “talking head” punditry for visceral, ground-level storytelling. We see meetup groups, Bitcoin block parties, and grassroots projects that paint a vivid picture of the Bitcoin culture in America’s heartland. The film’s narrative suggests that this grassroots movement carries almost evangelical hopes that Bitcoin’s decentralized technology and sound-money principles could remedy corruption and economic instability in the U.S.. With appearances by prominent advocates (from investors like Lyn Alden to educators like Saifedean Ammous), Bitcoiners captures a multifaceted snapshot of the Bitcoin ethos. Visually, the documentary moves from intimate moments in Texas – garages turned into mining farms, local meetups – to nationwide events like the Miami Bitcoin conference. Premiering in 2024, Bitcoiners is both a time capsule of the post-2020 Bitcoin renaissance and an optimistic testament to the power of community in driving a financial revolution.

God Bless Bitcoin,Socio-economic documentary,relevant,2024,Documentary,USA,1h 29min,July 2024,Brian Estes & Kelly Estes (co-directors),,God Bless Bitcoin Official Trailer,,"A thought-provoking documentary that asks if our current fiat money system – seen as unjust and tied to war and inequality – can be redeemed by Bitcoin, featuring perspectives from pastors, rabbis, imams, and Bitcoin evangelists on the moral case for sound money","God Bless Bitcoin frames the modern financial system as morally failing and explores Bitcoin as a solution through an unusual lens: religion and ethics. Co-directed by Brian and Kelly Estes, the film gathers interfaith religious leaders (from Christian pastors to a Rabbi and a Muslim scholar) alongside Bitcoin advocates to discuss how money intersects with morality. It argues that the fiat-based monetary system is “broken, unjust, and immoral,” pointing to how endless money printing fuels wealth inequality, warfare via the military-industrial complex, and the erosion of middle-class savings. Through testimonials and data, the documentary illustrates how hard-working people feel “a financial squeeze” even while doing everything right – a squeeze attributed to inflation and currency debasement that disproportionately harms the poor and middle class. The narrative then pivots to Bitcoin, suggesting it as “a more just, equitable, and peaceful” alternative. The film highlights Bitcoin’s fixed supply and decentralization as aligning with moral principles (fairness, honesty) cherished by major faiths. For example, one segment features a Christian theologian comparing Bitcoin’s transparency to “truth” and fiat’s opacity to “deception.” Meanwhile, a Muslim finance expert discusses the concept of riba (usury) and how constant inflation is akin to an unjust tax – implying Bitcoin’s stable rules could be more Sharia-compliant. Notably, God Bless Bitcoin doesn’t shy from Bitcoin’s critics: it acknowledges skepticism and addresses common concerns (volatility, illicit use) through respectful dialogue, attempting to show that many criticisms stem from misunderstanding. The film premiered at the Bitcoin 2024 conference, with a receptive audience of enthusiasts, but it’s crafted to reach beyond the choir – the inclusion of religious voices is meant to engage those who might not otherwise trust a tech or finance narrative. Visually, the documentary interweaves interviews with archival footage: scenes of central bank money presses, war footage tying fiat money to conflict, and uplifting imagery of community and charity supposedly enabled by a Bitcoin standard. This gives the film an emotional arc – from despair under the current system to hope in a Bitcoin future. By its conclusion, God Bless Bitcoin effectively functions as a moral appeal: it suggests that fixing money (via Bitcoin) could lead to a cascade of positive social outcomes – less debt slavery, fewer resource wars, more empowerment of the individual. While skeptics may dispute some causal links (and note that the film largely skips over Bitcoin’s own downsides), the documentary is a bold entry in the crypto cinema genre for focusing on ethics rather than tech or crime. It’s up-to-date as of 2024, mentioning events like the COVID-era money printing and El Salvador’s Bitcoin adoption as supporting evidence for its claims. Overall, God Bless Bitcoin is an earnest, faith-tinged take on crypto’s promise – “the first Bitcoin documentary that people of faith will understand,” as one early reviewer put it.","In God Bless Bitcoin, husband-and-wife directors Brian and Kelly Estes embark on what they call a “passion project” – motivated by witnessing families in their community struggle with skyrocketing living costs and eroding savings. The film opens by starkly illustrating these struggles: grocery prices climbing, young parents working overtime yet falling behind, and a montage of headlines about record government debt and money printing. It then poses its central question (both the tagline and a recurring refrain): “How do we fix our broken money?”. To answer, the Estes pair combine the spiritual with the financial. One segment visits a church soup kitchen, where a pastor speaks about how inflation has swelled his congregation of the needy; in another, a Rabbi recounts historical instances where currency debasement preceded social collapse – linking biblical teachings about fair weights and measures to modern monetary policy. The film firmly asserts that the current fiat system, tied to the U.S. dollar, is “intimately connected to the military-industrial complex and the propagation of war”. Footage of bombings and stock market tickers are juxtaposed, implying that endless money leads to endless war. The emotional crescendo comes as a diverse group of religious leaders collectively condemn the status quo: a Catholic priest labels unchecked inflation as “stealing from the poor,” an Islamic scholar nods in agreement citing principles of justice from the Quran, and a Buddhist monk comments on materialism and suffering. This interfaith consensus – that something is deeply wrong with how money works – sets the stage for Bitcoin’s introduction as a ray of hope. In the second half, the documentary shifts tone from somber to cautiously optimistic. Well-known Bitcoin proponents (like Tim Draper and Matthew Roszak) appear to extol Bitcoin’s virtues: no central authority can debase it, transactions can’t be censored, and it offers a path to financial sovereignty for the unbanked. The filmmakers smartly weave in testimonials from everyday people: a single mother in Argentina describes how saving in Bitcoin protected her from 50% annual inflation; an African small-business owner explains that Bitcoin allowed him to transact internationally when local banks failed him. These stories bolster the ethical case – portraying Bitcoin as a tool for empowerment and “self-sovereignty and community”, as Bloq chairman Matthew Roszak puts it. The phrase “God bless Bitcoin” itself is uttered by a clergyman in the film after he learns how it works, highlighting the blend of reverence and optimism the creators are aiming for. Cinematically, God Bless Bitcoin is well-produced: it uses animated infographics to show how the dollar has lost 97% of its purchasing power since the Federal Reserve’s inception, and contrastingly how Bitcoin’s issuance is mathematically capped. A stirring original score underlines the gravity of what’s at stake. By the documentary’s end, viewers are presented with a sort of moral call-to-action: to question the justice of the current money system and consider Bitcoin’s potential not in terms of quick profits, but as a foundation for a more virtuous society. While critics note the film’s clear pro-Bitcoin bias – it was partly funded by crypto donors and has an evangelical tone – even skeptics find its angle intriguing. It stands out among crypto films for engaging with moral philosophy and faith, broadening the conversation beyond tech circles. In 2025 and beyond, as debates over CBDCs (central bank digital currencies) versus decentralized currencies heat up, God Bless Bitcoin captures a snapshot of the idealism within the crypto movement at a time when many feel traditional economics has lost its way."
"Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery 
",The mysterious origins of Bitcoin and the true identity of its creator,relevant,2024,Documentary,USA,1h 40min,October 2024,Cullen Hoback,,,,"An HBO-produced thriller-style documentary that investigates Bitcoin’s origin story and the enigma of Satoshi Nakamoto, featuring interviews with key early Bitcoin figures and a globe-spanning search for the creator","Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery follows filmmaker Cullen Hoback as he delves into one of crypto’s greatest mysteries – who is behind Bitcoin? The film charts Bitcoin’s early history and the “wild goose chase” to uncover Satoshi’s identity. Hoback interviews prominent Bitcoin veterans (like Roger Ver and Adam Back) and even puts forward a controversial theory that developer Peter Todd could be Satoshi – a claim Todd denies in the film. Alongside the mystery, the documentary shows Bitcoin’s battle with regulators and its spread worldwide, questioning whether the cryptocurrency remains true to its founding principles as it enters the mainstream financial system. With high production values and access (produced by HBO and Adam McKay’s HyperObject Industries), Money Electric provides a rigorous yet speculative investigation into Bitcoin’s creation and early days.
","In this feature-length documentary, Cullen Hoback (known for Q: Into the Storm) turns his camera toward Bitcoin’s origin mythos and the hunt for Satoshi Nakamoto. The film blends tech history with detective work: it recounts how Bitcoin emerged from the ashes of the 2008 financial crisis and grew via cypherpunk forums, then pursues leads across continents in search of Satoshi’s true identity. Hoback interviews figures like “Bitcoin Jesus” Roger Ver and cryptographer Adam Back, who provide context on Bitcoin’s cypherpunk roots and the intense 2010s debates (e.g. the Blocksize War) that shaped its trajectory. A centerpiece of the film is Hoback’s bold hypothesis that Peter Todd’s early forum interactions and coding style hint he might be Satoshi. The documentary lays out circumstantial evidence – Todd’s technical corrections to Satoshi’s code in 2010 and simultaneous online disappearance – while acknowledging it’s speculative. Beyond the whodunit, Money Electric scrutinizes how far Bitcoin has come from Satoshi’s vision: from a rebel currency to an asset in retirement portfolios. It juxtaposes the ideal of a “bankless” currency with the reality of institutional adoption, asking whether Bitcoin has merely created a new elite of early adopters. Critics praised the film’s thorough research and suspenseful narrative, though some noted the frustration of an unsolved mystery (as even Hoback ultimately cannot conclusively identify Satoshi). Overall, Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery serves as both a primer on Bitcoin’s genesis and a thought-provoking exploration of the power of anonymity in a decentralized revolution, leaving viewers pondering how Bitcoin’s origin story influences its future"

The Highest of Stakes,Crypto biography,relevant,2023,Documentary,USA,1h 30min,August 2023,Patrick Moreau & Grant Peelle,,,,"A gripping documentary profiling Richard Heart – the flamboyant creator of Hex (a cryptocurrency promising outrageous returns) – as he navigates fanatical followers, allegations of running a Ponzi scheme, and the scrutiny of regulators. The Highest of Stakes chronicles the crazy highs and dangerous lows of a crypto community betting it all on one man’s vision","The Highest of Stakes provides an inside look at one of crypto’s most polarizing figures: Richard Heart, a self-styled “crypto king” known for his bombastic lifestyle (outrageous outfits, luxury cars, million-dollar watches) and for founding Hex – a token that some have called “the fastest appreciating asset ever” and others denounce as a textbook pyramid scheme. Filmed over the course of Hex’s meteoric rise in 2021 and its turbulent crash in 2022, the documentary embeds with Heart and his loyal “Hexican” community. It shows scenes from Hex meet-ups that feel akin to revival meetings – devotees chanting “RICH-ARD, RICH-ARD!” and sharing stories of newfound wealth after buying Hex early. The filmmakers smartly juxtapose this fervor with external commentary: journalists, blockchain analysts, and even a professor of finance weigh in with skepticism, dissecting Hex’s model of “promising 38% annual returns” as unsustainable and likely a bubble waiting to burst. Throughout the film, Heart is given ample screen time to defend himself. He’s charismatic and articulate, explaining Hex’s certificate of deposit-like design and insisting that as a finished product with no central admin, Hex cannot be a scam (since, as he says, “I can’t rug it – it’s locked in code”). The camera follows him as he lives extravagantly – at one point purchasing the largest black diamond in the world (renaming it the “HEX.com diamond”), which underscores both his marketing genius and the critics’ point that Hex’s value comes largely from Heart’s showmanship. As the title suggests, enormous stakes are on the line. We meet individual Hex investors: a single father who put his entire 401(k) into Hex, a young couple who quit jobs to “stake” Hex full-time, an early investor who became multimillionaire on paper. These personal stories add emotional weight – when Hex’s price later plummets ~90%, some of these same people are shown in despair or denial, illustrating the human cost of speculative fervor. By mid-documentary, regulatory clouds gather: the U.S. SEC announces an investigation into Hex and related schemes (this happened in reality in late 2022), and Heart’s public appearances become rarer. The film crew is there on the day Heart learns of law enforcement scrutiny, capturing an uncharacteristically subdued reaction – he refuses to comment on legal matters, an implicit acknowledgement of risk. The directors build tension by not revealing until the end whether Heart or Hex has faced any consequences (as of the film’s release, none officially). Instead, they focus on the tribalism and ethos of the Hex community – highlighting how decentralized finance can sometimes resemble a cult of personality. The documentary’s tone oscillates: at times it’s Wolf of Wall Street-like, reveling in the outrageous excess and euphoria; at other times it’s cautionary, with voice-overs reminding viewers of past manias (one expert notes parallels to BitConnect and other notorious crypto Ponzi schemes). Importantly, the filmmakers don’t take an overt stand – they present evidence and voices and let viewers decide if Richard Heart is a visionary or a con man. This even-handedness was praised by some reviewers: MovieBlogger.com said “it’s one of the best documentaries on the subject, a great portrayal of the cryptocraze”. Others, however, felt the film leaned too friendly towards Heart by granting him extensive input in production (Heart promoted the film to Hexicans as well). Regardless, for general audiences, The Highest of Stakes is an eye-opening ride. It encapsulates the exuberance and dangers of the 2020–2022 crypto boom through one larger-than-life protagonist. By 2025, with Heart now facing multiple lawsuits and Hex’s glory days seemingly over (its price never recovered to its peak), the documentary serves as both a time capsule and a warning. It reminds viewers how easily investing can cross into gambling and how charismatic figures can inspire extreme trust – or misplaced faith – in the unregulated world of crypto.
"," If one didn’t know The Highest of Stakes was a documentary, the storyline might sound like a Hollywood thriller. It starts with a flashy montage: private jets, Lamborghinis, and one man at the center – Richard Heart – bragging in one clip, “I have the world’s biggest diamond, the quickest Ferrari, and oh yeah, I started a cryptocurrency that went up 10,000%.” The scene cuts to a split screen: on one side, ecstatic Hex investors popping champagne as Hex’s market cap crosses $100 billion; on the other, somber financial pundits comparing Hex to a “gigantic house of cards.” This dramatic opening sets the stage for the film’s central conflict: Heart versus the world (or perhaps Heart’s ego versus reality). As the film unfolds chronologically, we see Heart in 2019 – overweight, in a T-shirt, livestreaming from home – pitching Hex as a new kind of high-interest blockchain savings account. Then fast forward to 2021: Hex’s price surges and Heart transforms into an ostentatious figure clad in Gucci tracksuits and top hats, hosting lavish conferences. The editing cleverly uses Heart’s own words to illustrate his transformation: early on he says, “I’m here to make people’s lives better” (cut to testimonials of Hexicans saying Hex freed them from debt); later he quips, “I brag differently… I show off to get attention, and then I teach people crypto” – a justification for his extravagance. This duality—altruist or narcissist?—is at the film’s core. Midway, the narrative shifts to those other voices: family members of Hex investors express concern that it’s too good to be true, a blockchain researcher breaks down Hex’s code and points out that early adopters (like Heart) got enormously rich from others buying in later (essentially outlining a Ponzi structure without outright calling it one). We also see footage of the Hex community’s social media: their slogan “Hexicans get rich for the glory of The Highest of Stakes documentary” trending on Twitter, and their aggressive defense of Heart against any critic (the film includes a scene where a skeptic blogger is doxxed and harassed by Hex fans). This illuminates how fervent—and insular—the group became, lending credence to cult comparisons. The climax of the documentary coincides with Hex’s crash in late 2022 and the SEC subpoena. Heart, who had been ubiquitous, suddenly cancels an interview with the filmmakers. In his absence, the final act relies on reflective commentary: some Hexicans expressing doubt (“Maybe we flew too close to the sun,” one says looking at a dwindling portfolio on his phone), while others double down on faith that Heart will deliver PulseChain (his next project) and vindicate them. The emotional peak is an interview with an older Hex investor wiping tears, admitting he mortgaged his house for Hex and now might lose both his home and his wife’s trust. It’s a gut-punch moment that underscores the film’s title – indeed, these people took the highest of stakes. The documentary concludes ambivalently: a title card notes that PulseChain launched in 2023 and that Richard Heart is under investigation, but also mentions Hex’s early adopters still hold significant wealth on paper. In the final shot, Heart finally reappears, defiant, saying, “They hate me ’cause I’m right. If Hex was a scam, I wouldn’t still be here.” That unanswered claim lingers as the screen cuts to black. For viewers in 2023 and beyond, The Highest of Stakes is both fascinating and unsettling. It captures a real slice of crypto history through a compelling character study, effectively showing how decentralized finance can breed centralized cults of personality. As one critic put it: “Ultimately, it’s a profile of the most charismatic man in the world” – a man who might be a genius, a fraud, or a bit of both. The film doesn’t settle the debate, but it starkly illustrates the extremes of risk and belief in the crypto era’s most dramatic boom-bust cycle.

Minted: The Rise (and Fall?) of the NFT ,NFT art market boom and bust,relevant,2023,Documentary,USA,1h 20min,June 2023,Nicholas Bruckman,,,,An insider’s look at the NFT explosion – from Beeple’s record-breaking $69 million sale to the 2022 crash – examining how this “crypto meets art” phenomenon rocketed to a $40 billion market and then imploded,"Minted captures a speculative mania in real time. It begins with the March 2021 Christie’s auction where digital artist Beeple sells an NFT for $69 million, igniting mainstream frenzy around non-fungible tokens. The documentary then follows an array of characters through the NFT heyday: artists like Beeple and Latasha Alcindor who suddenly find new markets for their work, twin sisters in Lagos building an NFT career, collectors making (and losing) fortunes, and skeptics raising alarms. The filmmakers had remarkable access – we see intimate moments like Beeple reacting to his overnight success, and heartfelt stories like how NFTs allowed marginalized artists to bypass traditional gatekeepers. However, as 2022 unfolds, the film doesn’t shy from the downside: “This was old school fraud,” remarks one interviewee in hindsight. Minted charts how sky-high valuations and hype gave way to scams, market oversaturation, and crashing prices.","The narrative arc of Minted mirrors a bubble’s lifecycle. Early on, there’s palpable excitement – vibrant NFT conventions, artists reveling in newfound empowerment (selling directly to fans via blockchain), and tech evangelists proclaiming a cultural revolution. One segment shows how NFTs enabled musicians and creators to earn income during the pandemic when live venues were shut. But as the film progresses, tension grows: we learn about speculators flipping jpegs for profit, “rug pull” projects leaving buyers with nothing, and environmental critiques of energy-hungry proof-of-work chains. The documentary gives equal voice to NFT champions and critics – e.g. Andrew Chow (TIME journalist) and law professor James Grimmelmann express deep skepticism about the sustainability and legality of it all. When the crash hits in 2022, we witness the fallout: artists scrambling as demand evaporates and collectors counting losses. Yet, Minted remains even-handed – it recognizes genuine creativity in the space while interrogating the excesses. By the end, viewers gain a nuanced understanding of the NFT era: not just a “tulip mania,” but a complex intersection of art, technology, culture, and greed. The film’s release on PBS/Netflix in 2025 – after the dust settled – provides timely reflection on what remains from the craze. (Notably, Minted was well-received, with an 83% Rotten Tomatoes score, though some critics felt its 80 minutes could barely scratch the surface of such a multi-faceted story.)

Lekker Feeling | A Bitcoin Ekasi Story,BTC adoption in Africa,relevant,2023,Short Documentary,South Africa / USA,14min,"July 11, 2023",Alexander Heil,,,,"A heartwarming short documentary about a South African township where surfing lessons and Bitcoin education go hand-in-hand, showing how one community-led program (Bitcoin Ekasi) is giving kids “lekker” (great) opportunities – from catching waves to stacking sats – as a path out of poverty","Lekker Feeling transports viewers to Mossel Bay, a coastal town in South Africa, where an unlikely combination of surfing and Bitcoin is changing young lives. The film centers on Bitcoin Ekasi, a program started by local surfer Herman Vivier to incentivize underprivileged kids with Bitcoin. Through vibrant footage, we see kids from a township hitting the beach – many learning to surf for the first time – and then gathering at a humble surf shack that doubles as a Bitcoin classroom. The documentary’s narrative explains that in this still racially divided region, surfing was traditionally a “rich man’s sport,” but now it’s being used to bring hope to township youth. After surf practice, the kids earn a few thousand sats as a reward (“Sats” – smallest units of Bitcoin), which they can spend at certain supportive local shops. We meet a 12-year-old boy, Aphiwe, who excitedly shows how he buys bread with a Lightning payment on a donated smartphone – his eyes light up at the independence it gives him. The filmmakers (sponsored by Cash App) highlight how financial literacy is folded into daily fun: one scene shows a coach using a simple analogy – “Stacking sats is like catching good waves; you save them up for a smooth ride later.” The short 14-minute runtime is packed with uplifting imagery of kids smiling, surfing, and learning, all underscored by upbeat local music.","In Afrikaans, “lekker” means “awesome” or “cool,” and Lekker Feeling indeed radiates a cool, positive vibe. The film’s opening has quick cuts of vibrant township street life and the nearby ocean waves, juxtaposed with a voiceover from Herman Vivier recalling the inspiration: “One day, I realized these kids around me had never been in the sea, nevermind heard of Bitcoin. Why not change both?”. The narrative structure follows a day in the life of the project. Early morning, coaches drive into the township (shots of unpaved roads, children running alongside) to pick up a dozen kids. We hear from one girl, Kaylin, who says “Before surfing, I’d never left the township. Now I feel the ocean is also mine.” On the beach, the film captures joyous moments: children falling off surfboards, then finally standing up on a wave – it’s impossible not to grin along with them. These scenes are intercut with Herman explaining the parallel with Bitcoin: “Just like surfing was unreachable to them due to cost, so was banking. We break both barriers.”. We see that breaking barriers in practice: after surfing, the kids head to The Surfer Kids clubhouse (a tiny building plastered with Bitcoin logos and surf posters). There, volunteer Aubrey Strobel (who helped produce the film) conducts a quick money game – she asks “What would you rather have: 50 rand or this shiny Casascius bitcoin coin worth the same?”, teaching them about the concept of sound money. The kids then scan QR codes to receive their earned sats (the film actually shows the Cash App interface doing a Lightning send – a bit of product placement, but subtle). A local shop owner, Mrs. Zanele, shares how she joined the experiment: she proudly displays a “Bitcoin Accepted Here” sticker and explains that for her, Bitcoin is now a community currency – “At first I changed it to rand daily, but now I often keep it. I’m even saving Bitcoin for my grandson’s education.”
Midway, the film addresses skepticism: a brief montage shows Herman facing questions at a community meeting – one elder man asks if Bitcoin is “real money or play-play”. Herman responds by having one of the kids, Mzwandile, use his wallet to pay the elder 1,000 sats and then immediately show him an exchange to rands – bridging the abstract to the concrete. The elder nods, “Yhu, ndiyabona, it works” (“Wow, I see it works”) he says, chuckling. Visually, Lekker Feeling is vibrant – colorful surfboards, the turquoise ocean, and the earth tones of the township create striking contrasts. The emotional peak comes near the end: a surprise event where the kids are taken to a surf competition in Cape Town. They watch professional surfers and even meet South Africa’s surf champion, who high-fives them. In a touching moment, the surf champ gifts a custom surfboard to the smallest boy from Bitcoin Ekasi, telling him, “You’re a surfer now, use this to chase big waves.” The boy’s eyes well up with tears of joy – and the film cuts to Herman noting “This board costs more than his family’s monthly income. Bitcoin donations made it possible.” Indeed, the film subtly underscores that Bitcoin fundraising (via Geyser and Twitter donors) has sustained and expanded the project.
By the film’s conclusion, a few months have passed and the camera revisits key figures: Kaylin now helps teach younger kids to surf (she says she dreams of being South Africa’s first black female surf pro “and I’m saving sats to make sure I travel someday”). Aphiwe has, with Herman’s help, paid for his first ever new school uniform in Bitcoin (they show him scanning a payment at a clothing store in town). Mrs. Zanele, the shop owner, reports an unexpected benefit – “The kids behave better; they know if they do mischief, Coach can cut their sats.” It’s a lighthearted note indicating a sense of discipline and responsibility growing among the youth. The final voiceover from Herman says: “We called it ‘Lekker Feeling’ because that’s what we want – for the kids to feel awesome, confident, included. Bitcoin is part of that recipe.”. The closing shot mirrors the open: kids laughing in the surf, then a freeze-frame on them holding a “Thank You Bitcoin” banner on the beach.
Upon release, Lekker Feeling resonated widely – garnering over 700,000 views across social media in weeks. It’s been cited in Bitcoin circles as proof of concept that micro-scale Bitcoin economies can uplift communities. Critics might note it’s a short, sponsored piece (Cash App’s involvement) and doesn’t delve into technical or macroeconomic issues – but that was intentional. As producer Aubrey Strobel said on a podcast, “We wanted to inspire, not lecture – to show the human side of Bitcoin’s potential”. And inspired it has: Bitcoin Ekasi reported a surge of support and volunteers after the film, meaning the “lekker feeling” is spreading well beyond Mossel Bay"

Directed by Greg Kohs, the film begins in the early 2010s when Armstrong, a former Airbnb engineer, first reads Satoshi’s white paper and dreams of making Bitcoin easier to use. We see the humble origins – Armstrong coding in a one-bedroom apartment – and then trace Coinbase’s path as it navigates Silicon Valley, gathers funding, and grapples with the exploding interest (and skepticism) in cryptocurrency. The documentary reveals behind-the-scenes moments from pivotal events: the chaos during Bitcoin’s 2017 bull run (Coinbase struggling to keep up with new users), internal debates over adding new coins, and high-stakes meetings with regulators who were unsure what to make of this “Wild West” of finance. It also highlights the personal side of founding a company – Armstrong’s introverted leadership style, his principled stands (like the controversial decision to keep Coinbase apolitical in 2020), and the toll of running a business at the cutting edge of a revolution. The climax covers Coinbase’s April 2021 direct listing on NASDAQ, marking a watershed moment where a crypto company achieved a ~$85 billion valuation on Wall Street","This documentary is often described as “a meticulous look at crypto and the ups and downs involved in the origins of Brian Armstrong’s Coinbase”, and it lives up to that billing. COIN: A Founder’s Story was filmed over several years, giving it an almost reality-TV level of access to Coinbase’s inner workings. Early scenes show Armstrong in 2013, soft-spoken yet determined, explaining to skeptical friends why Bitcoin matters – “I want to create an open financial system for the world,” he says, as archival clips depict the failures of the 2008 crisis that influenced him. As the company launches, we witness small victories (Coinbase enrolling early adopters, getting investment from Y Combinator) as well as crises – notably the documentary captures the Mt. Gox collapse in 2014 and how it spooked Coinbase’s users, and later the infamous outages when Bitcoin’s price surged and Coinbase’s servers went down, testing customer trust. A significant thread in the film is Armstrong’s philosophy: he is portrayed as laser-focused on legitimacy and compliance. The documentary shows him meeting with bankers and regulators, trying to convince them that Bitcoin isn’t just for illicit use, and hiring experienced lawyers to shape pro-crypto regulation. Viewers also get to see disputes within Coinbase – for example, debates on listing Ethereum in 2016 (some board members feared diversifying beyond Bitcoin; Armstrong pushed ahead, which ultimately proved wise). The narrative arc really picks up in 2017 when Coinbase is “at the right place at the right time” during the ICO boom: millions of users flood in, revenue skyrockets, but so do technical problems and support complaints. Armstrong’s leadership is tested; the film doesn’t shy from showing him under stress, occasionally clashing with colleagues, and making tough calls like suspending trading during overloads to stabilize the platform. By the time we reach 2020-2021, Coinbase has grown into a behemoth, and the film’s tone shifts to one of reflection and a bit of tension: Armstrong is about to take Coinbase public, but also famously publishes a blog post declaring Coinbase a mission-focused company (asking employees to leave political activism at the door). The documentary captures the fallout – some employees left, investors were anxious – yet Armstrong stands by his conviction, illustrating the “relentless focus” that he believes got Coinbase this far. The finale – the direct listing day – is genuinely emotional: we see early employees on a Zoom call watching the stock COIN debut at ~$381, cheers and tears as a decade of work comes to fruition. Throughout the film, commentary from industry figures (like venture capitalist Fred Wilson, and even Bitcoin skeptics turned believers) provides context: Coinbase’s story is used as a lens to explain Bitcoin’s journey from fringe to mainstream. The documentary, which Coinbase initially commissioned but allowed Greg Kohs to edit freely, has been praised for not feeling like a corporate promo. It frankly addresses controversies (like hacking attempts, compliance missteps, and criticisms that Coinbase “sold out” Bitcoin’s cypherpunk ideals to appease regulators). In the end, COIN: A Founder’s Story stands as a rare window into the startup grind behind a crypto giant, demystifying how technologies like Bitcoin get turned into user-friendly products. By preserving footage of Coinbase’s early days and Brian Armstrong’s thought processes, it effectively documents a crucial chapter in the history of digital finance – one that future crypto entrepreneurs can learn from."

Line Goes Up – The Problem with NFTs ,Critical examination of NFTs and crypto,relevant,2022,Documentary,Canada,2h 18min,"January 21, 2022",Dan Olson,,,,"A two-hour deep-dive by Dan Olson exploring the origins of crypto/NFTs, the technologies behind them, and an unsparing critique of why NFTs and Web3 are fundamentally flawed","Line Goes Up starts at the beginning – Olson walks viewers through Bitcoin’s birth during the 2008 financial crisis, then Ethereum’s creation, to set the stage for the NFT explosion of 2021. He patiently explains blockchain basics and the idea of digital ownership before launching into a systematic takedown of the NFT phenomenon. The video essay argues that NFTs largely “exist to get more people into the cryptocurrency industry”. Olson scrutinizes popular NFT art collections (like Bored Apes), finding the quality lacking and the value proposition empty beyond speculation. He critiques play-to-earn games (examining Axie Infinity’s collapse) and DAO schemes, likening many to pyramid or multi-level marketing structures. Throughout, Olson’s tone is analytical, often sardonic, backed by extensive research and citations.","In this essay-film, Olson takes an unabashedly skeptical stance: he contends that Web3’s core promise – empowering everyone – is a thin veneer over a new class of tech oligarchs and opportunists. He points out contradictions: the push for decentralization that results in re-centralized marketplaces (OpenSea), the rhetoric of “community” masking profit motives, and the environmental toll of proof-of-work chains fueling NFT minting. Notably, Line Goes Up was released at the peak of NFT mania; within months, the market indeed cratered, reinforcing many of Olson’s warnings. The video essay format allows Olson to be thorough: he spends time on the culture around crypto, from cringe-worthy celebrity endorsements to the fervent Twitter debates, illustrating a “collective delusion” driving the bubble. Despite tackling complex concepts, the documentary is engaging, using clear metaphors and occasionally humor to keep viewers invested through the lengthy runtime. By the end, Olson concludes that NFTs/crypto are not liberating innovations but “the beginning of a worse system intent on making everything a speculative price”. Love it or hate it, this film sparked widespread conversation – even garnering coverage in NPR, The Verge, and The New York Times for its incisive commentary on the crypto craze"
Trust No One: The Hunt for the Crypto King ,True-crime crypto fraud,relevant,2022,Documentary,UK/Canada,1h 30min,"March 30, 2022",Luke Sewell,,Trust No One: The Hunt for the Crypto King | Official Trailer | Netflix,,"After a crypto exchange’s young founder (Gerry Cotten) dies and $250 million vanishes, a group of betrayed investors band together online to investigate – uncovering a web of deception in the hunt for answers","This slick Netflix documentary retraces the rise and dramatic fall of QuadrigaCX through the eyes of its users. It opens with shock: thousands of customers learn their money is gone and the CEO is supposedly dead – but no one saw it coming. Feeling cheated and suspicious, some investors become amateur sleuths. The film follows these individuals as they scour blockchain transactions, comb through Gerry’s social media, and even travel to dig up death certificates. The narrative is tense and emotive, blending personal stories of financial ruin with the thrill of a whodunit. Conspiracy theories abound: is Gerry Cotten actually alive and living off the fortune? Was his death a cover-up orchestrated with accomplices? Each theory is weighed as clues (encrypted wallet records, Cotten’s earlier Ponzi-style ventures, etc.) emerge","Trust No One amplifies the human drama behind the Quadriga scandal. We meet ordinary people – a single mother, a crypto enthusiast – who entrusted life savings to QuadrigaCX and are now grappling with anger and guilt. The film interweaves their Zoom chats and Reddit threads with expert commentary to paint a fuller picture of Gerry Cotten’s character and possible motives. As the investigators inch closer to the truth, the documentary reveals bombshell findings: Cotten had been operating a classic Ponzi scheme, using new deposits to pay out old users, and siphoning funds to trade on other exchanges (and likely lose them). By the time of his “death,” Quadriga was deep in the red. The documentary’s climax covers the official investigation – including exhumation demands and law enforcement’s conclusion that Cotten indeed died (though under bizarre circumstances). While not everyone is convinced – hence “Trust No One” – the film concludes that the real crypto king was greed, and the victims’ newfound skepticism is the only silver lining. This story serves as a stark warning: in crypto, not your keys, not your coins, and even a king can’t be trusted"
Crocodile of Wall Street and the Battle Over Billions in Stolen Bitcoin,biggest crypto heist ever,relevant,2022,Documentary,USA,44min,"October 18, 2022",,,,,"A CNBC investigative documentary detailing the jaw-dropping tale of the Bitfinex Bitcoin heist – following how an eccentric New York couple allegedly laundered 119,754 stolen BTC (worth $4.5B) and became entangled in one of the biggest financial crime busts in crypto history","This CNBC documentary chronicles “the story of one of the biggest crypto heists of all time,” taking viewers from the moment of the 2016 Bitfinex exchange hack through the years-long investigation that led to the dramatic arrest of Heather Morgan and Ilya Lichtenstein in 2022. Nicknamed the “Crocodile of Wall Street,” Morgan is portrayed as a tech entrepreneur and amateur rapper (known for her alter ego “Razzlekhan”), while her husband Lichtenstein is a tech geek – together they’re alleged to have conspired to launder billions in Bitcoin. The film uses interviews with law enforcement agents (IRS Cyber Crimes unit, FBI) and insiders to show how authorities traced the stolen coins through the blockchain, despite the couple’s elaborate obfuscation techniques. It reveals quirky details – such as Morgan’s surreal rap videos and the couple’s low-key lifestyle – juxtaposed against the enormity of their hidden crypto fortune. The title refers to the legal battle over who will ultimately control the seized Bitcoin cache (worth over $3 billion at time of arrest) and the mystery of the hack’s true perpetrator. With a brisk 45-minute runtime, CNBC’s piece combines real-life suspense and techno-thriller elements, visualizing how agents followed digital breadcrumbs to a password-protected wallet containing 94,000 BTC stored in Lichtenstein’s cloud account","Crocodile of Wall Street and the Battle Over Billions in Stolen Bitcoin offers a fascinating deep-dive into a stranger-than-fiction crypto crime saga. It opens on the fateful morning of August 2, 2016, when Bitfinex users worldwide woke up to find 120,000 BTC missing from their accounts – one of the largest exchange hacks ever. The documentary then fast-forwards to 2022, as a multi-agency investigation zeroes in on an unlikely Manhattan couple: Ilya “Dutch” Lichtenstein and his wife Heather Morgan, who styled herself as a YouTube rapper and Forbes contributor. Through interviews and reenactments, CNBC shows how these two allegedly ended up in possession of the stolen Bitcoin. Viewers learn about Morgan’s flamboyant online persona “Razzlekhan” – complete with cringe-inducing rap songs bragging about taking “dirty money” – and how it earned her the infamous moniker “Crocodile of Wall Street”. The film doesn’t just revel in Morgan’s eccentricities; it also explains the sophisticated methods the pair supposedly used to launder crypto: from using false identities and darknet markets to converting Bitcoin into privacy coins. Law enforcement agents recount the painstaking chase, including a pivotal moment when they cracked Lichtenstein’s cloud storage and found a spreadsheet of wallet addresses – an “improbable rookie mistake” that led them to the loot. The documentary builds suspense as agents execute a search warrant on the couple’s apartment, discovering hardware wallets taped to peanut butter jars and other hidden keys to the fortune. Ultimately, Morgan and Lichtenstein are arrested and charged with laundering $4.5B in Bitcoin, in a case that stunned both the crypto community and the public. By blending traditional true-crime storytelling with explanations of blockchain tracing, Crocodile of Wall Street illuminates how even in the Wild West of crypto, criminals can be brought to justice. The piece underscores the paradox of Bitcoin’s ledger: the very transparency that Morgan mocked in rap lyrics became the tool that investigators used to unravel her scheme. Timely and compelling, this documentary serves as both a cautionary tale about greed and a lesson in how law enforcement’s crypto forensic capabilities have evolved by 2025.

Eraser: Reborn,Action thriller,outdated,2022,Action crime thriller,USA,1h 42min,"March 31, 2022",John Pogue,"Dominic Sherwood (as U.S. Marshal Mason Pollard), Jacky Lai (as Rina Kimura), McKinley Belcher III, Eddie Ramos",,,"A U.S. Marshal specializing in “erasing” high-risk witnesses finds his latest protectee – the wife of a crime boss – has stolen a crypto cold wallet loaded with her husband’s illicit fortune, forcing them into a deadly game of cat-and-mouse against assassins and corrupt agents.","Eraser: Reborn refreshes the mid-’90s witness-protection thriller for the 2020s by injecting a cryptocurrency caper into its plot. The film follows Mason Pollard (Dominic Sherwood), a U.S. Marshal who “erases” witnesses by faking their deaths and giving them new identities. He’s assigned to protect Rina Kimura (Jacky Lai), the wife of a notorious arms dealer who’s decided to turn state’s evidence. Unbeknownst to Pollard, Rina carries with her a small polycarbonate device – a hardware crypto wallet – that holds the keys to her husband’s secret cryptocurrency stash worth millions. Rina snatched the device and memorized its 24-word seed phrase before fleeing, hoping to use the funds as leverage for a new life. This high-tech twist quickly becomes central: when the criminal syndicate and a cadre of corrupt Interpol agents learn Rina has the wallet, they relentlessly pursue the pair from Los Angeles to Cape Town. The film revels in action set-pieces typical of the genre (car chases, shootouts, elaborate faked “erasures” of identities) while periodically reminding us of the digital stakes. In tense moments, Pollard and Rina hide out as she frantically enters her seed phrase into the Ledger-like device, trying to transfer funds – a scene that plays out with surprising accuracy to real crypto cold storage (the term “seed phrase” is explicitly used and explained in layman’s terms during the dialogue). This attention to a real-world detail has earned Eraser: Reborn a tongue-in-cheek reputation as possibly the first action B-movie to incorporate cryptocurrency wallet security into its story. The villains, of course, are mostly interested in the money: Rina’s mobster husband wants his Bitcoin back to continue bribing officials (dialogue notes he used crypto for bribes because it’s untraceable). As bodies drop and double-crosses are revealed, Pollard realizes his own agency contacts might be compromised – everyone is after this portable fortune. The film’s climax involves a standoff where the wallet’s physical indestructibility (it’s mentioned to be rugged and encrypted) is tested; ultimately, Rina demonstrates she’s memorized the backup seed, proving that without her knowledge the funds are inaccessible. This leads to a clever resolution: rather than a typical money briefcase exchange, the climax hinges on whether Rina will divulge the words in her head, effectively making her mind the vault. Though Eraser: Reborn is a straight-to-video actioner with fairly standard genre beats, its use of a crypto MacGuffin is novel and reflects the era’s zeitgeist – by 2022, even direct-to-DVD thrillers recognized that phrases like “cold wallet” and “Bitcoin password” had entered public consciousness. Technologically, it doesn’t dive deep (don’t expect lectures on blockchain; crypto is mainly a plot device), but it treats the concept with enough respect to get the basics right, which viewers versed in crypto will appreciate. In essence, it’s a familiar action reboot with a 21st-century twist: guns, fists, and Bitcoin keys.
","Eraser: Reborn brings the Eraser franchise into the digital age. In the original 1996 film, Arnold Schwarzenegger’s marshal dealt with mobsters and floppy disks; in 2022, Dominic Sherwood’s Pollard contends with cyber-savvy gangsters and cryptocurrency. The movie does a solid job of explaining its key tech element on the fly. Early in Act I, as Pollard preps Rina for relocation, he discovers a strange flash drive-like device among her belongings. “It’s a cold wallet,” Rina admits quietly – “It stores crypto… my husband’s money.” Pollard is initially furious, realizing this makes her a magnet for danger. Through their conversation (cleverly written to also inform the audience), we learn that the wallet is useless without a 24-word recovery key, which Rina has memorized and then wiped from the device for safety. “So you carry $10 million in your head?” Pollard asks incredulously – Rina’s tense nod confirms it. This setup raises the stakes considerably: if Rina is killed or coerced, the criminals could regain their fortune, but if she stays hidden, she effectively robs them of it. The film plays with this dynamic as Pollard and Rina go on the run. There’s a particularly suspenseful sequence in Cape Town’s harbor, where Rina, cornered, offers to “upload the wallet to the cloud” in exchange for her freedom, deliberately stalling for time as Pollard lines up a sniper shot. Here, Eraser: Reborn gets points for integrating crypto into a classic thriller formula – it’s not just a McGuffin in a briefcase; it’s something that must be handled carefully. The cold wallet’s presence even changes the nature of action scenes: in one fight, an assassin tries to destroy the ledger device, thinking that will eliminate the seed (not knowing Rina’s memorized it). The device ends up bullet-pocked but intact, demonstrating its physical security features, almost like an advertisement for Ledger. Throughout, the film sprinkles in bits of crypto jargon in a digestible way – e.g., Pollard quips “So much for decentralized safety” when an EMP blast fries their electronics including an attempt to transmit Bitcoin, highlighting the limitations of tech under fire. Ultimately, Eraser: Reborn wraps up its crypto subplot neatly. In the final scene, after the bad guys are defeated, Pollard hands Rina a new identity and passport. He then hesitates and returns the cold wallet to her, implying he expects her to do the right thing. In a nod to moral ambiguity, Rina does use a portion of the Bitcoin to reward an ally (a fellow witness) and donates some to a charity – a quick montage of anonymous BTC transactions – before discarding the device. She literally “erases” her crypto past to start fresh, which ties back to the film’s theme of wiping slates clean. In reviews, this film isn’t exactly critically acclaimed (it’s considered a by-the-numbers action flick), but crypto enthusiasts had fun with it. One Reddit thread jokingly called it “the stupidest crypto movie of all time” because of some absurd lines, but even those commenters acknowledged the seed phrase aspect was portrayed correctly. In sum, Eraser: Reborn might not be a groundbreaking cinema, but as a cultural artifact it shows how even mainstream action franchises began incorporating cryptocurrency into storylines by the early 2020s. It uses the technology in a way that’s easy for general audiences to grasp – essentially as digital cash on a device – while giving a wink to those in the know (the line “she commits it to memory then carries around a Ledger Nano as a decoy” could come straight from a crypto-security forum). As of 2025, the movie stands as a modest, entertaining reminder that crypto has firmly entered the lexicon of pop culture plot devices.

The Great Reset and the Rise of Bitcoin,Global macroeconomics meets Bitcoin,relevant,2022,Documentary,USA / Germany / Australia ,1h 18min,"January 5, 2022",Pierre Corbin,,,,An eye-opening documentary that traces the history of money and the perilous state of the global economy – from endless debt and money printing to the “Great Reset” agenda – and illustrates how Bitcoin’s emergence offers a path to sound money and individual sovereignty amid these brewing crises,"The Great Reset and the Rise of Bitcoin takes viewers on a sweeping tour of monetary history and contemporary economics before zeroing in on Bitcoin as a timely innovation. The film begins by explaining the concept of the “Long-Term Debt Cycle” (borrowing from Ray Dalio’s work) and how over the past century, major economies moved off the gold standard and embraced fiat currency, enabling governments to accumulate vast debts and print money at will. Through charts and archival footage, it illustrates how this debt-driven growth model led to periodic financial bubbles and crashes (1929, 2008), each met with more currency creation – essentially kicking the can but making eventual reckoning worse. The titular “Great Reset” is introduced as both a phrase from the World Economic Forum (pushing a top-down reimagining of the economy post-COVID) and a historical inevitability where the debt-laden system must reset (either via inflation or default). Into this narrative, Bitcoin is presented as “the rise of a new monetary system” that runs parallel to the decaying fiat one. The second half of the film methodically explains Bitcoin’s fundamentals (21 million cap, decentralized ledger) and how these properties directly counter the pitfalls of the current system. For example, it shows 40% of all US dollars were printed in 2020–2021, then juxtaposes that with Bitcoin’s inflation schedule (flashing the decreasing block subsidy and eventual 21M cap) – driving home the point that Bitcoin is hard money while fiat is easy money. The documentary interweaves expert commentary: Dylan LeClair, for instance, articulates how Bitcoin’s rise coincides with the end of a debt super-cycle – implying that as trust in central banks erodes, people will flock to a trustless alternative","Pierre Corbin’s film is as much a macroeconomics lesson as it is a Bitcoin primer, and it succeeds in linking the two. It’s structured in chapters with on-screen titles like “The Death of Sound Money,” “Inflation: Hidden Tax,” “The Great Reset,” and finally “The Rise of Bitcoin.” Each chapter begins with historical footage or quotes (for example, the inflation chapter opens with a 1971 Richard Nixon announcement ending gold convertibility, then cuts to modern scenes of money printing and inflation protests across various countries). The narrative tone is urgent yet educational – Corbin narrates calmly, but the content is alarming: showing how endless monetary expansion leads to wealth inequality and how the middle class gets squeezed by cost of living increases while asset owners benefit. The “Great Reset” portion of the title refers to a now-famous phrase by WEF’s Klaus Schwab (the film plays a clip of Schwab talking about harnessing the pandemic to “reforge society”). Rather than dive into conspiracy, the film frames the Great Reset as essentially the elite’s plan to maintain control in the face of the failing system – possibly via central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and more surveillance, as implied in one segment.
At the same time, it contrasts that top-down reset with Bitcoin’s bottom-up “financial revolution.” The pivot to Bitcoin is handled masterfully: an ominous montage of money printing presses halts, and the screen fades to Satoshi’s white paper excerpt (the line about “no trusted third party”). The music shifts from minor key to a hopeful tone. We then get a succinct, largely non-technical Bitcoin explanation – using simple animations, it demonstrates how Bitcoin mining works (depicted as digital gold miners securing transactions) and why no one can arbitrarily change Bitcoin’s rules (a network of nodes depicted pushing back against a single node trying to create more coins – a subtle nod to the Block Size War perhaps).
What sets this film apart is its use of data and concrete examples to make Bitcoin’s value proposition relatable. For instance, it highlights specific episodes of currency collapse: showing, say, a Zimbabwean shop in 2008 with trillions notes on the wall and a young Zimbabwean now explaining how he uses Bitcoin to protect his savings. It covers Argentina’s inflation through a local Bitcoiner’s perspective (one says “We all have two jobs: one to earn money, another to figure out how to preserve it” as Bitcoin’s price chart in ARS is displayed skyrocketing). These human stories underscore Bitcoin’s role as lifeboat in failing economies – tying back to the film’s thesis that a global fiat failure is brewing.
Critically, the doc anticipates skepticism: it addresses energy FUD by analogizing Bitcoin mining to the energy usage of the existing banking and military systems (presenting stats about data centers, etc.) and includes Nic Carter briefly debunking the “boiling oceans” myth. It also acknowledges volatility but reframes it as growing pains of a new asset in price discovery, encouraging a long-term lens (cutting to a 4-year HODL chart). The final chapter is forward-looking: as central banks face an impossible trilemma (raise rates and crash markets, or print and hyperinflate), the film suggests Bitcoin’s adoption will accelerate. It speculates a scenario by 2030 where more countries make it legal tender or add it to reserves (showing El Salvador as the pioneer). The tone becomes rallying: Alex Gladstein appears to emphasize Bitcoin’s role in human rights, calling it “a weapon for peace against oppressive financial regimes.”
In conclusion, the film returns to the phrase “The Great Reset” but gives it a twist – positing that perhaps Bitcoin, not the WEF, will usher in the real reset: a return to sound, decentralized money that resets the excesses of the past century. The credits roll with a montage: images of people using Bitcoin around the world – a street vendor in Nigeria scanning Lightning, an American family at a Bitcoin meetup, etc., underscored by a hopeful musical theme. A final caption invites viewers to “choose wisely between the old system and the new.”
Upon release, this documentary resonated strongly within Bitcoin communities (often recommended to newcomers) because it encapsulated why Bitcoin matters in the big picture. Some critics pointed out it leans heavily pro-Bitcoin and anti-central bank without presenting opposing views – which is fair, but the filmmakers made it clear the film is an advocacy piece as much as an explanatory one (the Nasdaq review explicitly calls it a guest post by Pierre Corbin, highlighting it’s one perspective). Nonetheless, with inflation hitting multi-decade highs in 2022 and many discussing “The Great Reset”, the timing was apt. In sum, The Great Reset and the Rise of Bitcoin compellingly connects macroeconomic dots to the Bitcoin solution, essentially arguing that as the old world’s money “self-destructs” through mismanagement, Bitcoin is rising to pick up the pieces, and it encourages watchers to be on the right side of that monetary revolution.

The documentary lays out how Cotten’s untimely demise in India – and the revelation that only he held the keys to $250 million of customers’ funds – plunged thousands into panic and spawned wild conspiracy theories. Through interviews and investigative footage, we learn about Gerry’s background, the exchange’s rise, and the red flags (e.g. funds siphoned to wallets named after Star Wars droids) that were ignored until it was too late. The film follows a cast of characters: grieving (and angry) investors, blockchain analysts tracing missing coins, and journalists uncovering Cotten’s secret past as a fraudster.","As a cautionary tale, Dead Man’s Switch is gripping. It pieces together the timeline leading up to Cotten’s December 2018 “death” – from his lavish lifestyle and wedding, to his reported Crohn’s-related passing and quick burial overseas. The documentary doesn’t shy from the bizarre: Was Cotten’s death faked as an elaborate exit scam? Did his new wife know more? Is the $215M gone forever or sitting in cold wallets? It visualizes the online sleuthing that took place (Reddit detectives, Twitter rumor mills) and the very real pain of investors who lost life savings. Director Sheona McDonald employs dramatic recreations of chat logs and uses “fleeting graphics” of transaction records to make arcane crypto concepts cinematic. In the end, while many questions remain unanswered (the film was made before some later revelations), Dead Man’s Switch serves as both a compelling mystery and a lesson about trust (or lack thereof) in the unregulated crypto Wild West. (The film earned critical praise for presenting the saga clearly – Wall Street Journal noted its strength lies in the interviewees’ insights amidst the intrigue.)

Idealistic entrepreneur Ross Ulbricht (Nick Robinson) launches the site to champion free trade outside government control, but it swiftly becomes a hub for drug trafficking, drawing the ire of federal authorities. The film intercuts Ross’s cat-and-mouse with law enforcement: Jason Clarke portrays fictional DEA agent Rick Bowden (a composite of real agents) who goes rogue to infiltrate and stop Silk Road. As the stakes escalate, Ross gets in over his head – facing betrayals, hitman plots, and the moral weight of his creation.","Based on a Rolling Stone article (“Dead End on Silk Road”), the film provides a tense overview of how youthful utopian dreams led to a dark-web empire and downfall. It showcases Ross’s transformation from idealist to fugitive “Dread Pirate Roberts,” and the parallel descent of Agent Bowden, whose methods to catch Ross become nearly as illicit as the crimes he investigates. While taking creative license, Silk Road highlights key real events – from the website’s booming success with anonymous Bitcoin-fueled transactions, to Ulbricht’s 2013 arrest in a public library with his laptop open to the Silk Road admin page. The film ultimately serves as a cautionary tale about libertarian tech visions colliding with legal and ethical realities, illustrating how Bitcoin’s promise of anonymous trade cut both ways. (Note: As a dramatization, it compresses and invents characters, but the core narrative reflects Silk Road’s significant chapter in crypto lore.)"

The group – including a bigoted field agent, a feminist techie, an MI5 agent, and others – tries to force Satoshi to divulge a “backdoor” to cripple Bitcoin. The interrogation spirals hilariously out of control as personalities clash and prejudices surface. When the captors accidentally dose themselves with a truth serum, everyone’s secrets (sexual, political, etc.) come tumbling out, yielding “riotous consequences”","Decrypted uses shock humor and farce to lampoon virtually everyone – the U.S. government’s paranoia about untraceable crypto, crypto-anarchists, and societal prejudices writ large. The film’s ensemble – a homophobic American agent, a transgender British asylum-seeker, a cynical hacker, a racist Brexiteer, and more – are forced into a kind of twisted group therapy under the influence of a truth drug. Amidst crude jokes and vulgar insults, they inadvertently find common humanity (while also nearly starting World War III!). Though the plot is fantastical, it weaves in real crypto lore: references to early Bitcoin intrigue and the mystique of Satoshi. The tone is edgy and provocative, not aiming for realism but for comedic commentary on intolerance and cooperation. By the film’s end, no one emerges the same – and the fate of Bitcoin itself takes a wacky turn. As a niche indie comedy, Decrypted delights in scandalous humor, making pointed if over-the-top commentary on the absurd extremes of both crypto evangelism and its detractors."
"Bitcoin Mining FUD Debunked – The “Fake Environmentalist Attack""",,relevant,2021,Interview,USA,27min,"November 16, 2021",,,,,"An informative rebuttal to the claim that Bitcoin mining is an environmental catastrophe. In this video, Nic Carter systematically dismantles the energy FUD, explaining how Bitcoin’s energy use is often exaggerated or mischaracterized and highlighting the renewable energy trends in mining","This video is essentially a masterclass in defending Bitcoin’s energy consumption. Nic Carter, known for his research on mining’s energy mix, explains that much of the outrage over Bitcoin’s electricity use is misplaced or in bad faith. He discusses how Bitcoin mining often uses stranded or excess energy that would otherwise be wasted, how miners are increasingly moving to sustainable power sources, and puts Bitcoin’s carbon footprint in context (comparing it to industries like aviation or construction that are far larger but receive less scrutiny). The interview format with Reason’s host allows for common concerns to be raised one by one – and Carter addresses each with empirical data and nuanced insight.

","Nic Carter’s energy debunking video came at a crucial time – in 2021, when headlines were blaring that Bitcoin was an “environmental nightmare” after a particular university study and Elon Musk’s tweets. In this piece (produced by libertarian outlet Reason TV), Carter labels much of the outrage as a “fake environmentalist attack on Bitcoin”, suggesting that certain critics are using environmental concerns as a pretext to undermine a technology they ideologically oppose. Throughout ~27 minutes, Carter coolly lays out facts: he notes that Bitcoin’s share of global CO2 emissions is fractions of a percent, that an estimated 60% (as of 2021) of Bitcoin mining was powered by renewable or non-carbon sources, and that mining’s flexible demand can actually help stabilize electric grids by soaking up surplus power. The video also addresses claims like “Bitcoin uses more energy than country X,” with Carter explaining why such comparisons are misleading (Bitcoin, unlike countries, is an open system anyone can verify, and its energy use is more transparent than that of banks or data centers which also consume huge energy). At one point, Carter points out that even if Bitcoin did consume a lot of energy, the key question is “Is it worth it?” – drawing parallels to the energy used by holidays lights or YouTube streaming, which society deems acceptable because they provide value. He argues Bitcoin provides unique benefits (financial freedom, censorship-resistance, a store of value) that justify its energy footprint – especially given its footprint is trending cleaner over time. The Reason TV production splices in visuals: shots of hydroelectric dams and solar farms powering mining rigs, charts from Carter’s research, and cutaways to extreme claims from mainstream media (which Carter then debunks). By the end of the video, a viewer comes away with a much more balanced understanding: Bitcoin’s energy use is real but not the apocalyptic threat it’s made out to be, and knee-jerk solutions like banning mining or changing Bitcoin’s code may actually be counterproductive. In 2025, this video remains one of the most cited explanations to counter energy FUD – a rational take in a debate often marked by fearmongering.

Libertas,Czech-Slovak documentary on cryptocurrencies,Moderately relevant,2021,Documentary,Slovakia,1h 3min,"January 6, 2021",Boris Vereš,,,,"A Slovak-produced documentary examining the crypto universe in Czechia and Slovakia – explaining for laymen how cryptocurrencies and blockchain work, why they’re important, and how a passionate local community grew around them","Libertas is an educational documentary that brings cryptocurrency down to earth for the average viewer. It delves into what Bitcoin and blockchain are, answering basic questions (“how do these technologies function, what benefits do they bring?”) in plain language. Uniquely, it’s grounded in the Czech-Slovak context: the film showcases early crypto adopters and entrepreneurs from those countries, highlighting that this region fostered a “very strong and globally significant crypto community” from Bitcoin’s early days. Through interviews and case studies, the film demonstrates practical crypto experiments happening locally – from Bitcoin ATMs in Bratislava to hacker houses in Prague. It also doesn’t shy away from skeptics: Libertas features commentary from a central bank representative and a finance ministry official, giving voice to concerns and criticisms, then counterpoints from crypto proponents.
","Titled after the Latin word for “freedom,” Libertas frames cryptocurrency as a technological quest for freedom in the financial realm. The documentary begins by noting that terms like “kryptomena” (cryptocurrency) are no longer foreign in Slovakia, but true understanding is rare. To bridge this gap, director Boris Vereš and his team set out in 2018 to film pioneers and thought leaders in their home region. The finished film (released in early 2021) feels part explanatory primer, part community profile. It alternates between segments that explain core concepts – using animations to show how blockchain ledgers achieve trust, or experts simplifying what gives Bitcoin value – and segments that profile real people in the Czech/Slovak crypto scene. We meet folks like Pavol Luptak, a Slovak crypto-anarchist, and Marek “Slush” Palatinus, the Czech creator of the world’s first Bitcoin mining pool. Their stories illustrate the film’s points about decentralization and innovation. Libertas also emphasizes the socio-political angle of crypto. It discusses how some citizens, frustrated by “social injustice and incompetence of state officials,” have decided to “minimize the negative impact of the state and financial institutions on their lives using crypto technologies.” The film asks viewers to consider that “there exists an alternative to the current financial system” – an eye-opening idea for those who’ve only known government-issued money. Importantly, Libertas remains balanced; it acknowledges that many people “resist these technologies” and includes voices of doubt. By the end, it doesn’t claim crypto will definitely succeed, but it posits that the coming decades will reveal blockchain’s true potential (or lack thereof). For a Western audience, the documentary provides an interesting regional flavor (with scenes in Prague’s Paralelní Polis crypto hub, etc.), while for local viewers it serves as a ground-breaking introduction. As the “first Slovak full-length crypto documentary”, Libertas played a key role in spreading awareness in its part of the world, and it stands as a snapshot of how Central Europe was engaging with the crypto revolution at the start of the 2020s."

Is decentralization a sustainable path? Through lively interviews with advocates and skeptics, the film examines Bitcoin’s evolution, the rise of Ethereum and altcoins, the promise of DeFi/Web3, and the battles between crypto idealists and regulators. Viewers are guided through blockchain’s technical concepts and ideological divides in an accessible way.
","Spanning 2015–2020, Cryptopia offers a balanced portrait of a maturing industry. It showcases blockchain’s origins (with insights into technologies like TCP/IP and cryptography) and future prospects. Hoffmann interviews early adopters and critics, illuminating debates on scalability, governance (Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin Cash), and the tussle between decentralization and corporate/government control. The documentary doesn’t shy from tough topics – it addresses crypto’s ugly truths (hacks, scams, environmental concerns) alongside its “good faith” innovators. Ultimately, Cryptopia gives viewers a primer on how far crypto has come and the long-term lessons for investors and the public. (Crowdfunded on Kickstarter and backed by Screen Australia, the film traveled worldwide for production, reflecting a truly global scope.)"

Taylor (as Max Sullivan), with Connor Sullivan, etc.",,,"A young man inherits 55,000 Bitcoins from his uncle, only to lose them through a single careless mistake – a darkly comic take on crypto fortune","This English-language micro-film packs a full cautionary tale into just a few minutes. Max, a hapless young man, receives an eccentric gift from his late uncle: some fishing rods, a taxidermy deer head… and a paper wallet holding 55,000 BTC purchased in 2010. Overnight, Max’s life transforms – on paper he’s a multi-millionaire. But as he gleefully plots out a lavish future, one tiny blunder (think lost password or discarded drive) causes the entire fortune to vanish
","HODL blends crypto folklore with slapstick tragedy. The title references the famous misspelling-turned-mantra “HODL” (“hold on for dear life”), which urges Bitcoiners not to sell. Max’s story illustrates why: had he simply HODLed securely, he’d be set for life. Instead, the short shows Bitcoin’s magic turning to misery in a flash – a hard lesson in security and humility. Despite the brevity, viewers (especially crypto veterans) will cringe and chuckle at the scenario’s plausibility. Ultimately, HODL serves as both a humorous intro for newcomers and a tongue-in-cheek warning to anyone handling digital gold: protect your keys, or your “healthy sum of Bitcoin can turn to smoke” due to one careless error"
"Feels Good Man 
","Pepe the Frog, meme culture",relevant,2020,Documentary,USA,1h 32min,"January 27, 2020",Arthur Jones,,,,"Feels Good Man follows cartoonist Matt Furie as he tries to reclaim his innocent creation, Pepe the Frog, after the meme was hijacked by extremist internet culture","This award-winning documentary tells the bizarre journey of Pepe the Frog – from a laid-back comic book character to a “registered hate symbol” of the alt-right. It charts how illustrator Matt Furie’s cheerful frog, popularized by the slogan “feels good, man,” went viral on early internet forums, only to be appropriated by anonymous trolls and far-right activists during the 2016 U.S. election. As Pepe’s image spread in online memes promoting hate and conspiracy theories, Furie finds himself in a surreal battle to save his creation’s soul. The film is at once an intimate portrait of an artist and a sweeping look at how online communities can transform art into something with real political power","Feels Good Man unfolds as a real-life fable about creative intent colliding with internet reality. In the beginning, we meet Pepe in his original habitat: a goofy, good-natured frog character in Furie’s indie comic Boy’s Club. Through vibrant animation sequences, the documentary brings Furie’s art to life, immersing us in Pepe’s early ethos of chill, stoner humor among friends. Pepe’s catchphrase – “feels good, man” – was just an innocuous joke in a comic scene. But as the film shows, once that image hit MySpace and later 4chan, it took on a life of its own. In Feels Good Man, we see how circa 2008–2014, Pepe became a viral meme used playfully across the internet. This initial popularity, narrated with a mix of nostalgia and regret by Furie, exemplifies the uncontrollable nature of memetic culture: creators often can’t predict or contain how their work spreads.
The tone darkens as director Arthur Jones traces how Pepe was co-opted by fringe online communities. Around 2015–2016, segments of the internet’s “alt-right” movement seized Pepe’s image, plastering the frog on racist, sexist, and anti-Semitic content. The once-wholesome frog was remixed into a grotesque caricature, appearing in hate-filled memes and even being tweeted by political figures. The film skillfully interweaves interviews with Furie’s friends, meme researchers, and alt-right figures to dissect this hijacking. It shows how Pepe went from just a meme to a symbol officially labeled as hate speech by the Anti-Defamation League. We watch Furie’s dismay as Pepe is declared a mascot of the nascent extremist movement – a transformation he never intended nor wanted. This middle act of the documentary feels almost like a horror story: Furie’s creation slips beyond his control, reflecting the broader theme that online, authorship and meaning can be wrested away from creators.
Determined to reclaim Pepe, Matt Furie takes action. Feels Good Man follows his efforts in the late 2010s to fight back against Pepe’s misuse. We see him pen an emotional one-page comic symbolically “killing” Pepe as a response to the chaos (an attempt to put the character to rest). He launches legal battles against companies selling hateful Pepe merchandise without permission. The film documents these challenges, showing Furie’s gentle personality tested by a very modern problem: how do you control a meme? Experts in intellectual property and internet culture weigh in, underscoring that Pepe had escaped into the public domain of ideas, beyond easy control. Yet, amidst the struggle, the narrative finds silver linings. In 2019, pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong unexpectedly adopted Pepe as an icon of freedom and resistance (painting him on banners as a positive symbol). This twist – Pepe reinterpreted for good – is depicted as a bittersweet victory, suggesting that a meme’s meaning is never fixed. The film’s climax shows Furie cautiously optimistic that Pepe can be saved or at least balanced by positive use.
Feels Good Man is richly layered with commentary on the “power of online imagery and the spin cycle of memes” in contemporary society. Beyond Pepe’s specific story, it explores how internet culture amplifies and distorts symbols at lightning speed. The documentary makes the case that memes like Pepe are modern folklore – once unleashed, they belong to the world, for better or worse. It raises big questions about artistic ownership, free speech, and the responsibilities of online platforms in an era where a joke can morph into propaganda. Importantly, the film remains empathetic towards Furie, grounding the narrative in his emotional journey. We witness his initial naiveté, his heartbreak at seeing his frog turned into “something terrible,” and his resolve to make it “feel good” again. By the end, Feels Good Man becomes a surprisingly emotional testament to an artist’s love for his creation and an examination of whether cultural symbols so badly tainted can ever be redeemed.
The documentary’s impact and craftsmanship have been widely recognized. It premiered at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival, where it won a Special Jury Award for its emerging director, Arthur Jones. Critics praised the film’s engaging, almost thriller-like narrative and its mix of whimsical animation with journalistic investigation. Feels Good Man went on to win an Emmy Award in 2021 for Outstanding Research, underscoring how meticulously it chronicled the Pepe saga. Reviewers noted that beyond internet trivia, the film “is a compelling look at an artist's journey to salvage his creation”, as well as a sobering lesson in unintended consequences in the digital age. By the time the credits roll – fittingly set to an upbeat tune by Pepe’s musician fans – viewers are left with a nuanced understanding of how a meme can touch lives and politics, and a newfound sympathy for the human behind the frog. In an era of deep fakes, viral misinformation, and online subcultures, Feels Good Man remains a highly relevant cultural touchstone that asks: when something goes viral, who owns its meaning?"
Crypto,"Cryptocurrency money laundering, financial crime, and cyber-investigation",Moderately relevant,2019,Crime Thriller,USA,1h 42min,"April 12, 2019",John Stalberg Jr.,"Beau Knapp (as Martin), Alexis Bledel, Kurt Russell, Luke Hemsworth, Jill Hennessy","CRYPTO Official Trailer (2019) Kurt Russell, Luke Hemsworth Movie HD - YouTube",,"A gritty financial thriller in which a young bank compliance officer uncovers a cryptocurrency laundering conspiracy involving art dealers and the mob, forcing him to navigate a deadly game of deceit where digital money and real danger collide","Crypto weaves together two worlds: the high-tech realm of cryptocurrencies and the old-school rural life of upstate New York. Martin (Beau Knapp) is first shown as a bright but socially awkward analyst at Omnicorp Bank in Manhattan, specializing in sniffing out money laundering. After he flags a $7 billion client for suspicious activity, corporate higher-ups unceremoniously exile him to his hometown branch in Elba, New York – a bucolic place struggling with economic downturn. Back home, Martin reconnects with his father (Kurt Russell), a cash-strapped potato farmer, and his old friend Earl (Luke Hemsworth), who now runs a failing liquor store but moonlights as a small-time crypto miner in his basement. The plot kicks into gear when Martin notices irregular transactions flowing through a local art gallery run by a sophisticated woman ( Alexis Bledel) and her partner. As he investigates, he discovers they are fronting for a Russian mob syndicate, converting dirty cash into cryptocurrency and then into art to launder it – a modern twist on hiding money in plain sight. The film ramps up tension with hacking sequences, clandestine meetings in the dark web, and the looming threat of hitmen, giving the audience a crash course in concepts like private keys and cryptocurrency tumblers amid the action. While Martin races to gather evidence, he must also protect his family when the criminals catch wind of his snooping. Crypto balances slow-burn procedural elements (unraveling how the laundering works) with bursts of action, and ultimately delivers a classic thriller climax of betrayals and showdowns, albeit with Bitcoin wallets and encrypted drives as key plot devices.","When Martin is first introduced, he’s decoding bank ledgers and explaining KYC (Know Your Customer) regulations to oblivious executives – painting him as a financial detective armed with algorithms and intuition. His forced transfer to rural Elba is depicted in stark contrast: he swaps skyscrapers for dusty roads and the family farm, where his father, Martin Sr., distrusts the very banks his son works for. The film uses this dynamic to comment on themes of trust and technology. Martin Sr. represents the old guard, preferring cash in hand, while Martin Jr. embodies the digital future – initially dismissive of Earl’s garage cryptocurrency mining rig, but soon realizing its significance when his investigation heats up.
As Martin audits the local bank’s pending accounts, he flags an inordinate number of wire transfers related to Katya’s art gallery. The gallery claims to be selling high-priced art to foreign buyers, but the payments are unusually structured. Using his forensic skills, Martin traces these transactions to Bitcoin wallets (the film visualizes this with a slick UI on Martin’s laptop, showing transaction hashes and amounts). He also discovers the use of a crypto exchange in Moscow with lax AML controls – a clear red flag. These details showcase how criminals exploit crypto’s pseudo-anonymity, a realistic nod to cases authorities have seen in real life. To further ground the scenario, Martin recruits Earl’s tech help; there’s a scene where Earl explains how a mixing service (or “tumbler”) scrambles the origin of funds, illustrating to Martin (and the audience) how the mob is covering their tracks on the blockchain.
The villains of Crypto are fleshed out through tense interactions. There’s Nikolai, the suave but menacing Russian intermediary, and Ted, the gallery’s accountant who handles the crypto conversions (played by Jeremie Harris). In one scene, Ted demonstrates the scheme to an underling: accepting a duffel bag of cash from drug sales, buying a load of bitcoin, then purchasing a piece of artwork with that bitcoin – the art sale provides a fake legitimate source for the funds, and the painting can be resold or stored as value. This step-by-step criminal tutorial is surprisingly informative, essentially walking the viewer through a complex money laundering operation with crypto at its heart. Meanwhile, Martin, realizing the danger, tries to get support from his distant Wall Street bosses, but corporate corruption and apathy leave him on his own – a plot point underscoring a David vs. Goliath element: a lone analyst versus powerful, tech-savvy criminals and complicit bankers.
The personal stakes escalate when Martin’s father’s farm loan (held by the same shady bank) suddenly comes due as pressure from the mob. In an emotional moment, Martin Sr. confronts his son, frustrated that all Martin’s expertise can’t save their family farm from foreclosure – a subplot that humanizes the financial thriller and ties into Martin’s motivation to set things right. As threats mount, including a break-in at Martin’s home and Earl being coerced by the mob, Crypto shifts into full thriller mode. Martin uses an encrypted USB stick to download incriminating records from the gallery’s computer, leading to a cat-and-mouse chase both online (decrypting files while evading counter-hacks) and offline (dodging mob enforcers). The climax unfolds with Martin luring the key players into a final transaction that he’s covertly reported to federal agents – guns are drawn in the gallery amid a cryptocurrency transfer hitting the blockchain, a unique pairing of action and digital suspense.
While Crypto received mixed reviews for its cinematic merits, it stands out for weaving real cryptocurrency concepts into a mainstream narrative. It doesn’t present Bitcoin in a glossy or utopian way; rather, it integrates it into the criminal underbelly, reflecting genuine concerns of the late 2010s when news stories were rife about Bitcoin’s use in money laundering and cybercrime. However, it also shows some positive angles: Earl’s small crypto mining operation is portrayed as harmless entrepreneurship, and Martin himself sees that the technology is neutral – used by bad guys in this case, but also holding potential to liberate (echoing what his friend Earl argues about decentralization in an earlier bar conversation). In the end, Crypto functions on two levels: a serviceable thriller with family drama and crime intrigue, and an educational piece about the intersections of cryptocurrency with the worlds of finance and law enforcement. For audiences in 2019, it was among the first fiction films to treat Bitcoin as an integral plot element, and for today’s viewers, it remains a cautionary tale of how the innovation of cryptocurrency can be co-opted by those lurking in the shadows, even as the industry strives for legitimacy."

Trust Machine: The Story of Blockchain ,Blockchain applications for social good,relevant,2018,Documentary,USA,1h 24min,"October 26, 2018",Rosario Dawson,"Vinay Gupta (Ethereum strategist), Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto, startup founders from ConsenSys and LO3 Energy, activists using blockchain for social causes",,,"A thought-provoking documentary that broadens the lens beyond Bitcoin, showcasing how blockchain technology – as a “Trust Machine” – could empower individuals and solve real-world problems in finance, energy, and governance","Trust Machine sets out to answer the question: Can we trust code over central institutions? It begins by examining the erosion of trust in banks and Big Tech, then presents blockchain as a “machine for creating trust” among strangers. Rosario Dawson’s narration guides us through examples that make blockchain tangible. In one segment, we visit a Brooklyn microgrid project where neighbors trade solar power using blockchain tokens – a practical demonstration of peer-to-peer energy markets. Another segment features Hernando de Soto working on a blockchain land registry to secure property rights for the poor in developing nations, highlighting blockchain’s potential to fight corruption. The film also spends time on Ethereum and smart contracts, explaining how they enable “programmable money” and decentralized apps. A particularly moving case study involves activists in Africa using blockchain to bypass oppressive banking systems or verify news during internet blackouts, underlining themes of freedom and human rights. Throughout, Trust Machine intercuts interviews with industry leaders (from the co-founders of Ethereum to lawyers and journalists) to provide insight and occasionally skepticism. The documentary doesn’t shy from noting the hype and scams of the 2017 ICO boom, but its overall tone is hopeful and solution-oriented, suggesting that while the blockchain space had excesses, the core innovations can address systemic issues if harnessed correctly","Narrated with clear enthusiasm by Rosario Dawson, Trust Machine opens in a Syrian refugee camp. There, a digital identity pilot project uses blockchain to help refugees prove their identity and access aid. This emotionally powerful introduction immediately frames blockchain as a humanitarian tool, far from the usual talk of trading and speculation. From there, the film’s structure flows through several thematic chapters, each focusing on a societal domain potentially transformed by blockchain’s distributed trust architecture.
In the “Energy & Environment” chapter, the film introduces viewers to a project called LO3 Energy in Brooklyn. Through interviews with residents and project leads, we see how a blockchain-based microgrid lets solar panel owners sell excess power directly to their neighbors, using tokens and smart contracts to settle trades every 15 minutes. Visuals of Brooklyn brownstones with solar panels, and an easy-to-follow animation of energy flowing and tokens exchanging, make the concept graspable. The takeaway: blockchain can decentralize not just information, but also power (literally and figuratively).
Switching gears, “Financial Inclusion” is illustrated by a ride to Africa – specifically, a startup in Tanzania where unbanked villagers use a blockchain-based platform on basic cell phones to secure loans and build credit histories. There’s footage of a rural market where a woman proudly shows an SMS on her phone indicating she received a microloan via cryptocurrency. This is juxtaposed with commentary from economists who explain how blockchain can create a ledger of trust in communities where traditional banking falls short. The film candidly notes challenges too: volatility of crypto assets and the need for user education.
One of the most compelling threads is “Property and Governance.” Here, Trust Machine follows renowned economist Hernando de Soto in rural Peru as he documents the plight of villagers who lack formal titles to their land. The film shows de Soto partnering with technologists to pilot a blockchain land registry, theorizing that an immutable public ledger of land ownership could prevent governments or corporations from unjustly seizing land. Drone shots of vast farmlands and close-ups of farmers holding up handwritten deeds underscore the importance of secure property records. Alex Winter includes a historical anecdote: after Haiti’s 2010 earthquake, land records were destroyed, causing chaos – a problem a distributed ledger might have mitigated.
The documentary also covers free speech and censorship resistance. We meet developers from projects like Steemit (a blockchain-based social media) and Civil (a blockchain journalism platform). Through their experiences – for instance, a journalist explaining how blockchain could verify news archives so governments can’t erase them – the film argues that blockchain can fortify truth in the face of authoritarian censorship. There’s a segment about activists in China using Ethereum’s blockchain to post an open letter (as a transaction note) that authorities couldn’t delete – a small but powerful example of “code is mightier than censors.”
Despite its generally optimistic stance, Trust Machine doesn’t ignore the downsides of the blockchain craze. It touches on the ICO bubble of 2017, featuring clips of outlandish token sale pitches and noting how easy money and lack of regulation led to scams. A blockchain lawyer interviewed remarks that the hype cycle was a double-edged sword – bringing attention and investment, but also fraud. This section serves as a sober reminder that any nascent technology goes through growing pains. Winter uses it to reinforce why focusing on real use-cases (like those highlighted in the film) is crucial rather than getting lost in speculative fervor.
As the film moves toward conclusion, it circles back to a fundamental notion: trust. The phrase “Trust Machine” is explained – a term popularized by The Economist to describe blockchain. By now, the audience has seen multiple instantiations of that idea, from trustless energy markets to trusted land records to trust in information. Rosario Dawson’s narration notes that while blockchain isn’t a panacea, it introduces a new framework for collaboration and verification in an increasingly digital, globalized society. In closing, the film presents a montage of ongoing projects and a final thought that resonates: If the first era of the internet was about information, the next era – powered by blockchain – could be about value and trust. For viewers, especially in 2025, Trust Machine remains a highly relevant and inspiring snapshot of how far blockchain has come and how far it might still go in reshaping our world for the better."
"Bitcoin: Beyond the Bubble 
","Explaining Bitcoin’s value proposition and staying power, in light of skepticism that it’s a bubble destined to burst",relevant,2018,"Short, Documentary",Australia,35min,"May 1, 2018",Tim Delmastro,"Andreas M. Antonopoulos, Trace Mayer, Catherine Austin Fitts (economist), among others providing commentary",,,"A brisk, educational film that cuts through the “Bitcoin is a bubble” debate by explaining in plain language how Bitcoin works, why it has value beyond speculation, and what problems it aims to solve in the modern financial system","Released directly to the internet to reach the widest audience, Bitcoin: Beyond the Bubble feels like a well-produced video essay. It begins by acknowledging the elephant in the room: Bitcoin’s price had skyrocketed and crashed more than once, leading many to label it a classic bubble. The documentary’s mission is to show that bubbles can contain something real. It methodically addresses fundamental questions: How did Bitcoin come to be? What issues in traditional finance does it address? Why is there trust in this digital money at all? The narrative uses simple metaphors – comparing Bitcoin’s fixed supply to the finite nature of gold, for example – and includes several “man on the street” segments where people attempt to explain what they think Bitcoin is, often humorously underscoring misconceptions. To provide authoritative answers, the film cuts to experts who explain concepts like blockchain immutability (why you can’t fake a Bitcoin), or the benefit of cutting out middlemen in transactions. The title “Beyond the Bubble” reflects the latter part of the film which paints an optimistic future: Bitcoin and its underlying tech could be as revolutionary as the internet – meaning even if speculative manias come and go, the innovation itself will persist","The documentary opens with news montage: exuberant headlines of Bitcoin hitting record highs, followed by cynical soundbites calling it tulip mania 2.0. This setup establishes the skeptic’s perspective. The narrator (with a friendly Australian accent) then poses, “If the notion of Bitcoin intrigues you, yet you find the techno-jargon intimidating, this film is for you.” From there, it launches into a crisp breakdown of Bitcoin’s origin story – the whitepaper, the early adopters – making sure to emphasize how it was a response to mistrust in banks after the 2008 crisis. We see visuals of printing presses to signify quantitative easing versus the 21-million coin limit to signify Bitcoin’s programmed scarcity.
Key analogies drive the points home: one expert likens the blockchain ledger to “a Google Docs spreadsheet that everyone can see and verify, but no single person can alter to cheat.” Another analogy used is the internet analogy itself: just as early dot-com skeptics couldn’t imagine Amazon and Google emerging from the wreckage of the dot-com bust, early crypto skeptics might lack the imagination for what Bitcoin could lead to. To tackle the bubble question head-on, the film explains that yes, Bitcoin’s price is volatile, and bubbles have formed (like the 2017 run-up), but it argues that volatility is natural in the adoption phase of any groundbreaking technology. Historical examples are cited – the railroad stocks bubble of the 1800s, or the more contemporary dot-com bubble – which eventually gave way to industries that changed the world. The underlying message: bubbles don’t necessarily mean “worthless”; sometimes they accompany the introduction of something genuinely transformative.
Throughout its runtime, Beyond the Bubble remains viewer-friendly. It frequently defines terms in on-screen text (e.g. “Blockchain: A distributed ledger that…”) the moment they are mentioned. It also uses graphic overlays – for instance, when an economist says “Bitcoin removes the need for trust,” a simple diagram appears showing two strangers transacting directly with a checkmark indicating success. Toward its conclusion, the documentary shifts to why Bitcoin matters socially. It touches on the unbanked populations who can now access a global economy with just a phone, references countries like Zimbabwe or Venezuela where Bitcoin has been a lifeline during currency collapse, and highlights that big banks themselves started researching blockchain (implying that even skeptics were won over by the tech). The final takeaway delivered by the narrator is that while nobody can predict Bitcoin’s price, its invention has started a paradigm shift in thinking about money and trust – one that will continue beyond any speculative bubble. With that, the film ends on a montage of innovations (images of blockchain in healthcare, renewable energy trading, etc.), suggesting Bitcoin was just the first spark of a broader blockchain revolution. As a bite-sized documentary, Bitcoin: Beyond the Bubble succeeded in educating millions online (judging by its view count and shares) and remains a relevant introduction to Bitcoin’s core value proposition for anyone still wondering, “But is there more to this than the hype?”"

The documentary proceeds in a logical, beginner-friendly structure. First, it recounts the creation of Bitcoin in 2009 by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, highlighting the intrigue around Satoshi’s identity. Next, it breaks down how Bitcoin works: clear animations and expert analogies explain blockchain basics – how transactions are verified by miners solving puzzles, how the supply is limited, and why decentralization provides security. The film then delves into the philosophy behind Bitcoin, featuring interviews with early adopters who discuss themes like monetary freedom, inflation resistance, and the power of being one’s own bank. Skeptics’ viewpoints are briefly acknowledged (e.g. concerns that it could be a bubble or used by criminals), but Magic Money leans optimistic. It muses about potential future scenarios: Will Bitcoin or its successors replace national currencies? Could they bank the unbanked in developing countries? The documentary’s tone is one of wonder – treating Bitcoin as a possibly “revolutionary” development in the story of money","Opening with the famous quote “Bitcoin is the most dangerous open-source project ever created,” Magic Money immediately posits that something profound is at play. The film is divided into clear segments, each introduced by on-screen titles. The “Origins” segment dramatizes the 2008 financial crisis and then the release of the Bitcoin whitepaper. In lieu of Satoshi himself, the film uses narration over simple graphics to convey his vision – an electronic peer-to-peer cash that doesn’t need banks. Early Bitcoin footage is shown: forums, the first block mined, early adopters like Hal Finney tweeting “Running bitcoin”. This historical approach gives weight to the idea that Bitcoin emerged as a response to broken banking systems.
In the “How It Works” chapter, experts like software engineers and Bitcoin miners break down the technology. One miner demonstrates a mining rig, fans whirring, while explaining proof-of-work in layman’s terms. An economist in the film uses an analogy of the gold standard: “Think of Bitcoin like digital gold – mining is like digging gold, except with computers, and the blockchain ledger is like a giant public bank ledger everyone can see”. Visual aids – flowing binary code, spinning coins, network diagrams – accompany these explanations to keep them engaging. By the time the viewer hears that only 21 million BTC will ever exist, the film has made sure they understand why scarcity plus utility gives Bitcoin value.
The “Why It Matters” part of Magic Money is essentially a series of testimonials from Bitcoin enthusiasts (Jeff Berwick, Roger Ver, etc.) underscoring Bitcoin’s revolutionary aspects. We see Roger Ver recount how he moved money overseas in minutes with Bitcoin, something that would’ve taken days via banks. Trace Mayer passionately argues that Bitcoin returns power to individuals, protecting them from central banks that “steal value via inflation.” There’s mention of Venezuela’s currency collapse, implying Bitcoin could be a lifesaver in such scenarios – a point that proved prescient in later years. Yet, the film also briefly touches on criticisms: a banker voice (one of the few skeptics interviewed) warns that Bitcoin’s volatility makes it unreliable, and a law enforcement official notes its use on darknet markets. These counterpoints are acknowledged but not deeply explored; the documentary’s heart clearly lies with the crypto believers.
In its final act, Magic Money widens the lens to ponder the future. It poses questions like, “Can governments stop Bitcoin, or will they join it?” At the time of filming, Japan had just started recognizing Bitcoin legally, and that is cited as evidence that the revolution is underway. The narrative imagines scenarios: someday your paycheck might be in cryptocurrency; developing nations might leapfrog traditional banking using mobile crypto wallets. One interviewee even calls Bitcoin “the Internet of money”, suggesting it will do to finance what the internet did to information – a bold claim that is left for the viewer to consider. The film concludes on a cautiously optimistic note: Bitcoin may or may not be the ultimate form of money, but it has undeniably sparked a movement challenging us to rethink what money is. As the credits roll, the audience is left with the sense that they’ve glimpsed the dawn of something significant. In hindsight, Magic Money serves as a snapshot of mid-2010s sentiment: when Bitcoin was no longer an obscure geek secret, but not yet the institutional asset it would become. It captures that mix of mystery, skepticism, and hope that defined Bitcoin’s narrative in 2017, making it a useful introduction even today for those looking to understand why Bitcoin captured imaginations around the world"
The Blockchain and Us ,Blockchain technology’s potential beyond Bitcoin,visionary for its time,2017,"Short, Documentary",Switzerland,31min,March 2017,Manuel Stagars,,,,"A globetrotting documentary that asks visionaries across industries how blockchain technology could change the world, from finance and supply chain management to governance and art – a thought-provoking primer on why blockchain matters beyond Bitcoin","With an elegant, minimalist style, The Blockchain and Us does not attempt to explain technical mechanics. Instead, it posits big-picture questions: How will trust be redefined in a decentralized world? Could blockchain be as revolutionary as the internet or the airplane? Through a series of short interviews, the film collects insights and analogies that help convey blockchain’s significance. For example, one expert likens blockchain to the early days of the World Wide Web, suggesting we are only beginning to grasp its uses. Another interviewee, a legal scholar, muses about smart contracts automating agreements and what that means for law and society. The documentary’s strength is in the diversity of perspectives – we hear from a startup founder in Silicon Valley, a banker in London, a researcher in Germany, a blockchain hub organizer in South Korea – all reflecting on how this technology might empower individuals or disrupt institutions. The tone is generally optimistic and inquisitive. By the end, viewers come away with a sense that blockchain is a multifaceted tool that could “profoundly change how we cooperate as a species,” but also with an understanding that these changes come with social and ethical considerations (raised by a psychologist who talks about human trust). Though only a half-hour long, The Blockchain and Us succeeds in inspiring curiosity and further discussion, making it a solid visionary piece for its time.","This documentary doesn’t follow a traditional narrative or character arc; instead, it’s structured as a collage of voices and ideas, underscored by a gentle musical score and scenic footage of cities around the globe. Manuel Stagars sets the stage with a brief narration: he recounts how Bitcoin’s invention in 2008 led to the broader realization that the blockchain – a distributed ledger – has uses far beyond digital cash. Then the film jumps into interviews, often introduced by the interviewee’s name and title on-screen. One of the first is a software developer who helped build early blockchain platforms – he explains in simple terms that for the first time, “we can have an internet of value, not just information,” emphasizing that anything from money to property titles can potentially be managed on blockchains without central authorities.
As The Blockchain and Us moves from one expert to another, it covers an expansive range of scenarios: finance (how blockchains could enable micro-payments or bank the unbanked), supply chains (tracking goods transparently from origin to consumer), music rights (ensuring artists get paid directly when songs are played), and e-voting (creating tamper-proof electoral systems). Each interviewee brings their own metaphor or story – a venture capitalist describes blockchain as a new trust layer for the internet, while a Brazilian banker compares the current blockchain stage to the early days of email, where skeptics abounded. Interspersed with these talking heads are visual interludes: drone shots of shipping ports, trading floors, or vast server farms, each reinforcing the topics discussed (like shipping containers for the supply chain segment).
Crucially, the documentary addresses not just the what and how of blockchain, but the why. A sociologist points out that much of our modern world runs on centralized trust (banks, governments, big corporations) and asks viewers to imagine a future where trust is distributed among the many, not held by the few. There’s excitement in her voice as she suggests this could reduce corruption and empower communities, but also a caution that technology alone doesn’t solve human nature issues. Towards its conclusion, The Blockchain and Us becomes somewhat philosophical. One expert reflects on the concept of decentralization as part of a larger historical trend – comparing it to the Gutenberg printing press enabling decentralized knowledge. Another speculates that blockchain networks could someday interact with AI and IoT (Internet of Things), creating autonomous systems that run without human oversight.
By the end credits, the viewer hasn’t been given a step-by-step tutorial on blockchain; instead, they’ve been exposed to a tapestry of possibilities. In 2017, many ideas raised were hypothetical, but watching it now in 2025, one realizes several of these once-hypotheticals are now real pilots or products (for example, supply chain tracking on Ethereum or national digital currencies on blockchains). The Blockchain and Us thus endures as a visionary snapshot, capturing a moment when the world was just waking up to blockchain’s potential and encouraging us to dream big about how this technology could unite technologists, business leaders, and social change-makers in shaping the future"
Bitcoin Heist ,Crypto-cybercrime and heist,somewhat relevant,2016,"Action, Crime Thriller",Vietnam,1h 50min,"February 5, 2016",Ham Tran,"Kate Nhung, Thanh Pham, Petey Majik Nguyen, Suboi",,,"A globetrotting tech-heist thriller where an Interpol agent recruits a team of misfit experts – a hacker, a thief, a magician – to hunt down a criminal mastermind who’s hoarded a fortune in Bitcoin, leading to elaborate digital and real-world cons","Bitcoin Heist delights in blending classic heist tropes with the geeky glamour of cryptocurrency. The plot kicks off when an Interpol operation to capture “The Ghost” – a notorious hacker stealing bitcoins from around the world – goes awry. Realizing conventional tactics won’t work, Agent Dada (Kate Nhung) assembles an unconventional crew: there’s Jack Magique, a street magician/con artist; Luhan, a young hacker girl; Vi, a femme fatale thief; and other quirky recruits, each with a role in the complex plan. The film leaps from one daring set-piece to another: phishing scams, hacking duels, and high-speed chases are all choreographed with slick action. Importantly, the screenplay peppers in explanations of how crypto-wallets work and what a blockchain is, ensuring viewers understand what’s at stake (one character even uses a brainwallet – memorized passphrase – to secure his funds). Though the technical details are often exaggerated for excitement, the core premise is compelling – digital money that can be stolen by anyone with the keys, making for a heist target that’s everywhere and nowhere at once. Bitcoin Heist keeps a playful tone, mixing trust-no-one twists with light comedy (as the motley crew bickers and bonds). By the finale, double-crosses abound and it’s revealed that the ultimate hack might be more social engineering than software. This movie doesn’t aim to be realistic, but it successfully captures the zeitgeist of crypto’s early intrigue and the notion of a new kind of treasure for thieves to chase in the 21st century","The film wastes no time in establishing its digital caper credentials. In the opening sequence, Interpol agents interrupt a lavish blockchain conference to corner a suspect, only for him to escape via a remote laptop hack that empties attendees’ bitcoin wallets in seconds – a scene that sets the energetic, slightly campy tone. Frustrated, Agent Dada decides to “fight fire with fire” by recruiting criminals who have the skills she lacks within the law. Each member of her heist team gets a stylish introduction: for instance, we meet Magic Jack doing card tricks that demonstrate sleight of hand (foreshadowing his role in duping targets), and BitBuster Luhan as she infiltrates a bank’s computer system for fun, showcasing hacking prowess. The target: The Ghost, who lurks on the dark web and has accumulated a huge cache of bitcoins from ransomware attacks and exchange heists. Because Bitcoin transactions are public on the blockchain, Dada’s team can trace The Ghost’s funds – but they need to trick him into revealing his identity and private keys.
What follows is a whirlwind mission that spans locales (from Ho Chi Minh City’s streets to a luxury resort where a crypto-millionaire’s auction is taking place). The crew employs a mix of tech and old-school tricks: phishing emails to grab passwords, disguise and infiltration to plant hardware keyloggers, and even an elaborate staged illusion where Jack uses his magician’s skills to make a hardware wallet disappear in plain sight. The filmmakers weave in actual crypto terminology – at one point, the characters debate the merits of cold wallets vs. online wallets, and a breach occurs through a compromised two-factor authentication device, giving a nod to real security issues. All the while, the film maintains a breezy, comic-book flair; for example, rapper Suboi’s character deftly pickpockets a USB stick containing bitcoins, only to find it encrypted, prompting a humorous yet tense hacking montage.
As the climax nears, Bitcoin Heist reveals that not everything is as it seems: crew members have hidden agendas and The Ghost might be closer than anyone realized. A standout twist involves a blockchain timestamp – the heroes realize a transaction’s metadata spells out a clue, a creative plot device tying into how blockchain records work. In true heist genre fashion, audiences are treated to a final reveal where flashbacks show how the team (and the film itself) misdirected our attention, just like a magic trick. By the end, justice (of a sort) is served, and millions in stolen crypto change hands in a flurry of laptop keystrokes and clever deceptions. While decidedly speculative in its portrayal of cryptocurrency capabilities, Bitcoin Heist captures the excitement of Bitcoin’s early wild west days and imagines a world (set in 2020) where digital currency is central to both law enforcement and criminal enterprises. Its fun, adventurous take helped demystify Bitcoin for some viewers and showed that even global finance’s next big thing could be translated into popcorn entertainment. For those looking for a light-hearted thriller that involves crypto – and don’t mind some technobabble – Bitcoin Heist is a unique entry in the genre."
Banking on Bitcoin ,"The creation of Bitcoin, its early growth, and the ideological battles between crypto innovators and financial authorities",somewhat relevant,2016,Documentary,USA,1h 30min,December 2016,Christopher Cannucciari,,,,"A comprehensive documentary on Bitcoin’s early days and its collision with the traditional banking world – from the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto and cypherpunks, to the Winklevoss twins and government regulators shaping the cryptocurrency’s future","Banking on Bitcoin spans the timeline of Bitcoin’s first seven years, bringing viewers from its cypherpunk inception to its status as the poster child for financial disruption. The film features rare footage and explanations of pivotal events: the release of Bitcoin’s whitepaper in 2008, the first Bitcoin transaction for pizza in 2010, and the wild price swings that garnered media attention. It profiles key figures in the Bitcoin saga, giving personal depth to names often seen in headlines. For instance, we hear from Charlie Shrem, the young entrepreneur who founded BitInstant and later went to prison for indirectly aiding Silk Road transactions – his story becomes a lens to discuss the gray areas of crypto law. The documentary also covers the ideological rift between Bitcoin’s early idealists (who saw it as “the future of money” for empowerment) and the traditional financial institutions (and even some opportunistic “Bitcoin companies”) trying to control or profit from it. A significant portion of the film is dedicated to the New York hearings that led to the BitLicense regulation, with interviews from both proponents of regulation and Bitcoin evangelists who feared it would stifle innovation. Through these narratives, Banking on Bitcoin illustrates the clash between the decentralized dream and the reality of governmental oversight.","The film opens by introducing the enigmatic Satoshi Nakamoto, whose absence looms as a mythical figurehead throughout the story. Using simple analogies and visuals, Banking on Bitcoin explains how blockchain technology works – the idea of a public ledger maintained by miners – and why this concept of trustless money gained a devoted following. We meet early miners and coders who speak with almost religious fervor about Bitcoin’s potential to democratize finance. As Bitcoin’s value climbs from pennies to hundreds of dollars, the documentary shows how this once-obscure project caught the attention of venture capitalists (like the Winklevoss twins of Facebook fame) and eventually Wall Street. The narrative takes a dramatic turn when it recounts the fall of Mt. Gox, the largest Bitcoin exchange, which collapsed in 2014 after losing customers’ bitcoins – an event presented as Bitcoin’s “Lehman Brothers moment.” Interviews with affected users convey the heartbreak and loss of trust that ensued. Yet, Bitcoin survives, and the film suggests its antifragility sparked even greater interest and scrutiny.
What truly distinguishes Banking on Bitcoin is its focus on the people and politics around Bitcoin. The filmmakers sit down with financial journalists and regulators who were initially skeptical – their commentary helps viewers understand the concerns around money laundering, volatility, and consumer protection. In contrast, prominent Bitcoin advocates (like Erik Voorhees and Andreas Antonopoulos) articulate a vision of Bitcoin as a tool for freedom, outside the control of “too-big-to-fail” banks. This tension climaxes in scenes covering 2015’s New York BitLicense hearings, where these two worlds confronted each other. The film captures this as a seminal moment: on one side, figures like Benjamin Lawsky (then NYDFS Superintendent) arguing the need for rules to tame the “Wild West” of crypto; on the other, crypto entrepreneurs warning that heavy regulation would simply drive innovation away. By the end, Banking on Bitcoin leaves viewers with a sense of having witnessed history in the making. The closing notes highlight that Bitcoin, despite obstacles, continued to grow and inspire a whole new industry. Many interviewees express that we are only at the start of a longer story – a sentiment that rings true in 2025. While some aspects are outdated (the market has since seen ICOs, DeFi, and more), the documentary remains a foundational time capsule of Bitcoin’s chaotic rise, capturing the ethos of an era when it was unclear whether cryptocurrency would be squashed by regulators or embraced as the next big thing"
Deep Web ,"Dark web markets, Silk Road drug marketplace, and Bitcoin’s role in online crime",slightly outdated,2015,Documentary,USA,1h 30min,"March 15, 2015",Alex Winter,,,,"A gripping documentary about the Silk Road dark web marketplace and its takedown, illustrating how Bitcoin enabled a global black market and raising deep questions about privacy, technology, and government control","Deep Web provides an insider’s view of one of the 21st century’s most compelling crime sagas: the rise and fall of Silk Road. Narrated in somber tones by Keanu Reeves, the film first explains what the “deep web” is – the encrypted, unindexed part of the internet – and how technologies like Tor and Bitcoin collided to create an online Wild West. It then chronicles Silk Road’s growth into a $1.2 billion marketplace for drugs and illicit services, all paid in Bitcoin to preserve anonymity. The core of the documentary follows the FBI’s hunt for the site’s operator, alleged to be 29-year-old Ross Ulbricht, and the ensuing legal battle. By featuring interviews with Ulbricht’s family, attorneys, and journalists, Deep Web humanizes the protagonist and poses thought-provoking questions about crime and punishment in the digital age. The film doesn’t shy away from controversy – it discusses allegations that Ulbricht commissioned hits on enemies (charges later dropped) and exposes the murky tactics law enforcement may have used to penetrate the site. Ultimately, Deep Web is as much about ideology as it is about crime: it contrasts Ulbricht’s libertarian vision of a free market beyond government reach with the ethical and legal dilemmas that such a market created","The documentary opens by painting a picture of the internet’s underbelly. Through archival footage and expert commentary, viewers learn how the dark web operates in parallel to the surface web: users access it via the Tor browser, and Bitcoin provides an untraceable currency for transactions. With this context, Deep Web recounts the genesis of Silk Road in 2011. We see how a libertarian-minded idealist (purportedly Ross Ulbricht) built a sleek e-commerce site that he likened to “Amazon for drugs,” founded on principles of personal freedom, privacy, and voluntary exchange. The site’s success was staggering – tens of thousands of listings for narcotics, fake IDs, and hacking tools, all paid with Bitcoin and delivered by mail. Alex Winter’s film highlights that while Silk Road horrified law enforcement, it also had defenders: the narrative includes perspectives of academics and activists who argue that Silk Road reduced street violence (by moving trade online) and that Ulbricht’s severe sentencing raised civil liberties issues.
The climactic focus is Ulbricht’s 2015 trial. Deep Web gains extraordinary access – featuring Ulbricht’s parents, who profess their son’s innocence and criticize the investigation, as well as journalist Andy Greenberg, who had corresponded with the Dread Pirate Roberts. Tense courtroom sketches and transcripts reveal a courtroom drama that questioned the very nature of the internet. Ulbricht was ultimately convicted and handed an unprecedented double life sentence, a punishment the film suggests was intended to send a message. In its final act, Deep Web steps back to explore the broader stakes: Do we value privacy online, even if it enables criminal activity? Is Bitcoin to blame for facilitating anonymous crime, or is it simply a neutral tool? With Ross Ulbricht’s fate sealed (pending appeals), the documentary closes on a poignant note – contrasting a mother’s sorrow for her imprisoned son with the enduring debate over how society should handle the “darknets” that Bitcoin and encryption have made possible. For viewers in 2025, Deep Web remains a powerful historical document of Bitcoin’s early association with the dark web, even as that narrative has evolved with new chapters (from ransomware to darknet market successors). It underscores that the tension between technological freedom and abuse is not easily resolved, a theme still resonating in today’s crypto dialogues"
Dope,Bitcoin in a drug-dealing caper,slightly outdated,2015,"Comedy-Drama, Crime",USA,1h 43min,"January 24, 2015",Rick Famuyiwa,"Shameik Moore, Tony Revolori, Kiersey Clemons, A$AP Rocky, Zoë Kravitz",,,"A hip, witty teen comedy that transforms into a high-stakes caper when its young heroes start selling drugs on the dark web using Bitcoin, blending social satire with an unlikely crypto twist","Dope is primarily a nostalgic teen adventure about 1990s hip-hop culture – until it swerves into the present day by incorporating Bitcoin and the darknet. Malcolm and his friends – straight-A students and self-proclaimed geeks – accidentally come into possession of a backpack full of Molly (MDMA). Determined not to get killed by gangsters or arrested, they hatch a plan to offload the drugs safely. The solution? Set up an online store on a Silk Road–like black market and accept payments in bitcoin, which they’ve learned is “that PayPal for drugs”. The film takes a humorous yet informative approach as the teens scramble to learn about crypto: there’s a montage of them mining bitcoins on old laptops and using QR code wallets – a sequence that introduced many moviegoers to Bitcoin basics in 2015. As orders roll in, the friends evolve from naive amateurs into savvy darknet vendors (in over their heads), leading to suspenseful and comic moments as rival dealers and FBI agents close in. Through its rollercoaster plot, Dope subtly comments on how a kid from the projects can leverage technology – coding, e-commerce, and cryptocurrency – to outsmart a system stacked against him. The Bitcoin subplot, while somewhat fantastical, underscores the film’s broader theme: the collision of youthful ingenuity with the chaotic opportunities of the digital age","Malcolm’s life in Inglewood is defined by duality: he’s a straight-laced “nerd” who loves 90s rap and gets straight As, but he’s also navigating a rough neighborhood dominated by drug dealers and gangs. Dope establishes this contrast with kinetic energy and humor, following Malcolm and his two equally nerdy best friends (Jib and Diggy) as they skate through schoolyard bullies and dream of getting into Harvard. The first act of the film is a vibrant slice of life, packed with retro style and satire about what it means to be a black geek in the hood. Then, through a chance encounter at a party, Malcolm ends up with a drug lord’s stash of ecstasy. Suddenly, the story shifts genres – from teen comedy to crime caper. Facing pressure to sell the drugs without getting caught, Malcolm taps into his academic smarts and the tools at his disposal: the internet and a nascent digital currency.
In one memorable scene, the trio seek advice from a stoner hacker who explains how the dark web works. With a few keyboard clicks, they set up an online storefront on a hidden website (a nod to Silk Road) and list the pills for sale. Payments will be in Bitcoin, which the film depicts as the go-to money for illegal deals due to its pseudonymity. As orders pour in from across the country, Malcolm’s gang uses their school’s IT lab to mine extra bitcoins and fulfill orders, cleverly hiding their activities behind innocent-looking screens. The comedic tension ramps up when a tech-billionaire VC (very much a parody of real-world Bitcoin investors) gets involved, providing a crash course in cashing out bitcoins to real dollars – but not without extracting his own pound of flesh. By the film’s climax, Malcolm must outwit both the thugs and the authorities, culminating in a confrontation that forces him to step out of his timid persona. Ultimately, Dope uses Bitcoin as more than a gimmick; it symbolizes Malcolm’s resourcefulness and the new avenues technology opens for those who understand it. In the final voiceover, as Malcolm contemplates his college application essay, the presence of Bitcoin in his journey highlights how non-traditional knowledge (coding, crypto, internet culture) can empower someone to break socio-economic chains. Though the film’s use of Bitcoin is somewhat fantastical and played for laughs, it was one of the first mainstream films to depict cryptocurrency, marking a moment when Bitcoin was entering public consciousness beyond purely tech circles. Today, that aspect may feel dated (no one needs to explain “what is Bitcoin” anymore), but it remains a fascinating cultural artifact of Bitcoin’s early crossover into Hollywood.

Bitcoin: The End of Money as We Know It ,The monetary history and Bitcoin’s challenge to traditional fiat systems,outdated,2015,Documentary,Australia/USA,1h,July 2015,Torsten Hoffmann and Michael Watchulonis,,Bitcoin: The End of Money As We Know It (Trailer),,"A concise, award-winning documentary that explores the evolution of money – from gold and fiat currency to Bitcoin – and makes the case for why cryptocurrencies could upend the financial world","Through an engaging mix of historical footage and expert interviews, Bitcoin: The End of Money as We Know It walks the viewer through how money as we know it came to be, and why Bitcoin represents a radical departure. The first half of the film is a crash course in monetary history: it explains how governments assumed control of money, the advent of central banks, and issues like inflation and currency debasement. Using vivid examples (from Weimar-era hyperinflation to the 2008 financial crisis), the documentary argues that trust in centralized money has been frequently abused. It then introduces Bitcoin as a “people’s currency” – a decentralized, algorithmic system that isn’t subject to money-printing or political manipulation. By featuring leading voices in the crypto space (like technologist Andreas Antonopoulos and economic thinker Jeffrey Tucker), the film balances enthusiasm for Bitcoin’s promise with acknowledgment of its challenges (volatility, regulatory pushback)","Bitcoin: The End of Money as We Know It serves as both a primer on what money is and a manifesto on what money could be. The documentary begins by asking fundamental questions: Why do pieces of paper or numbers on a screen have value? Who decides how much money is circulating, and what gives it worth? To answer these, the film journeys from the barter systems of ancient civilizations to the minting of coins backed by gold, and eventually to the era of government-issued fiat currency. With clear narration, it exposes how modern banks create money through loans (the fractional reserve system) and how central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve can stimulate economies by printing money – sometimes with perilous consequences. The 2008 financial meltdown is presented as a turning point: a loss of faith in traditional finance that set the stage for Bitcoin’s emergence in 2009.
Midway, the tone shifts to optimism as Bitcoin is introduced as “the Internet of money.” Hoffmann’s film breaks down complex concepts like blockchain, mining, and digital scarcity into layman’s terms, often with animations and analogies. Viewers learn that only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist, in contrast to ever-expanding fiat supply – framing Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation. The documentary also explores Bitcoin’s ideological roots: interviews with early adopters and libertarians highlight the desire for a currency beyond any government’s control. While largely positive about crypto, the film doesn’t ignore critiques: it raises questions about volatility, the association with online crime, and whether governments might outlaw such currencies. By its conclusion, The End of Money as We Know It compels the audience to reconsider the very nature of money and ponder a future where financial power shifts from central banks to code. The film’s content remains highly relevant – especially as debates rage on in 2025 about inflation, banking trust, and whether Bitcoin truly is “digital gold”"

Set in mid-2013 – when Bitcoin’s public awareness was minimal – the documentary captures the couple’s resourcefulness as they hunt for businesses that might accept Bitcoin (often convincing them on the spot). They pay their landlord in crypto, fuel their car via gift cards bought with bitcoin, and even manage to arrange cross-country travel, all without touching a dollar. Along the way, they speak with Bitcoin evangelists and skeptics, illuminating perspectives on this “magic internet money” during its early days. The film balances lighthearted moments (like bartering Bitcoin for burgers at a diner) with an educational narrative about the promise of a decentralized currency. By immersing viewers in the Craigs’ day-to-day struggle, Life on Bitcoin makes the abstract concept of cryptocurrency tangible and relatable","In this indie documentary (funded by a Kickstarter campaignaustinmcraig.com), Austin and Beccy start their married life on a bold financial experiment. With no credit cards, no cash, and no bank accounts, they load up a Bitcoin wallet and set a rule: if a product or service can’t be bought with bitcoin, they do without. The film’s narrative unfolds as a series of challenges that mirror Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. Shelter? They persuade their skeptical landlord to accept rent in bitcoin by arranging a local trader to convert it to dollars. Food and gas? They rely on the few tech-savvy local merchants or buy gift codes on a Bitcoin-only marketplace to use at big-box stores. Each day brings small victories and comic frustrations – from trying to tip waitresses in bitcoin to explaining what Bitcoin is to perplexed cashiers.
As their journey progresses, the couple ventures beyond their Utah hometown, proving that living on Bitcoin is possible even on the road. They drive cross-country powered by fuel purchased with bitcoin and even fly to Europe, navigating flights and hotels via crypto-friendly intermediaries. Interwoven with their personal story are interviews with Bitcoin pioneers like venture capitalist* Roger Ver* and journalist Kashmir Hill (who herself once lived on Bitcoin for a week)austinmcraig.comaustinmcraig.com. These discussions add context, explaining Bitcoin’s origin and its potential to upend traditional finance. By the experiment’s end, Austin and Beccy reflect on how Bitcoin pushed them out of comfort zones – forging human connections whenever they found someone willing to trade bitcoins for goods. The film concludes on an optimistic note that, while Bitcoin in 2013 was impractical for most, the rapid growth of infrastructure and interest hinted that a crypto-powered future was on the horizon. In hindsight, the documentary is both charmingly outdated and visionary: many obstacles they faced (like lack of Bitcoin point-of-sale apps) have since been overcome, validating the Craigs’ belief that they were early participants in what would become a worldwide phenomenon."
The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin,"Early Bitcoin adoption, community and mining",outdated,2014,Documentary,USA,1h 36min,"April 23, 2014",Nicholas Mross,,The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin | Official Trailer (2014),,"A Bitcoin-enthusiast documents the burgeoning cryptocurrency revolution, traveling the world to meet early adopters and evangelists of Bitcoin.","This award-nominated documentary offers a firsthand look at Bitcoin’s genesis, following Daniel Mross as he balances work and family life with an all-consuming passion for Bitcoin. Through interviews with key players – from core developers to startup founders – the film traces Bitcoin’s evolution from a little-known open-source project to a global phenomenon. The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin also doesn’t shy away from early controversies, touching on exchange failures and legal troubles that befell some early Bitcoin entrepreneurs. By the end, viewers gain an insightful chronicle of the cryptocurrency’s tumultuous early years, complete with its “rah-rah” optimism and the hard lessons learned along the way","The documentary begins in 2011, when Daniel Mross discovers Bitcoin and sets out to explain this “magic internet money” to a broader audience. What unfolds is Daniel’s globe-trotting journey into the heart of the Bitcoin movement at a time when one Bitcoin was worth only a few hundred dollars. He visits living rooms and startup offices where miners and entrepreneurs are building the Bitcoin economy from scratch. Through Daniel’s eyes, we meet early adopters like Gavin Andresen (Bitcoin’s lead developer after Satoshi’s departure) and entrepreneurs like Brian Armstrong (founder of Coinbase), who share their dreams of reinventing finance. The film captures the Wild West quality of those days – from basement mining rigs buzzing with heat, to meetups of idealists who believe Bitcoin could bank the unbanked and challenge the global monetary system.
As Bitcoin’s popularity surges, the film also covers the growing pains of a nascent industry. It highlights the collapse of Mt. Gox (through an interview with former CEO Mark Karpelès) and the arrest of Charlie Shrem, illustrating that “not everyone involved in Bitcoin early made it out unscathed”. Yet, The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin maintains an enthusiastic tone, documenting milestone events like the first major Bitcoin conferences and the coin’s leap in value. By the documentary’s end (circa 2014), Bitcoin is on the cusp of broader awareness, and the film stands as a historical snapshot – outdated in details but invaluable for understanding the movement’s roots. For anyone curious about how the crypto craze began, this film offers an insider’s view of the tech, the ideology, and the community that sparked the financial revolution."
